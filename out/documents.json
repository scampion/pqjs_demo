    "summary": "The European Parliament and the Council have reached a provisional agreement on updated rules on the labelling of organic pet food, which will align them with the rules on the labelling of organic food for human consumption. For pet food to carry the EU organic logo, 95 % of all its agricultural ingredients will have to be organic. The update was necessary as the current regulation on organic labelling allows feed to be labelled as organic only if all the agricultural ingredients come from organic production, without an exemption for pet food. The agreement resulting from interinstitutional negotiations, approved in committee on 28 June 2023, is expected to be put to the vote in Parliament's plenary in September.",

    "title": "Establishing a horizontal European climate label for products",
    "summary": "An effective climate labelling scheme requires a methodology, a database, and a label format that allows consistent comparison both within and across product categories. To this end, we analyse the EU product environmental footprint (PEF) methodology, the state of databases on climate footprints, the current knowledge on effective label design, and relevant EU regulation. Based on this analysis, we conclude that further preparation is required before a voluntary, horizontal climate labelling scheme can be established under Union law, across all product categories. Specific improvements are proposed to harmonise and simplify the PEF methodology. We also propose that a globally complete, consistent, and open background database is established and maintained, with an acceptable level of product detail. A label design is proposed that allows seamless cross-category comparison and consideration of the 'monetary rebound' effect, as well as easy communication of uncertainty. The development of a roadmap is also proposed. This should consider the broader context of environmental and sustainability labelling and the need to improve international product life cycle assessment standards and harmonise conflicting EU calculation rules.",

    "title": "Act in support of ammunition production (ASAP)",
    "summary": "On 3 May 2023, the Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing the act in support of ammunition production (ASAP). On 9 May 2023, the European Parliament agreed to trigger the urgent procedure under Rule 163 of its Rules of Procedure in order to proceed quickly with the proposal, without a report. On 1 June 2023, the plenary agreed to refer the file back to the Industry, Research and Energy Committee (ITRE), for interinstitutional negotiations on the basis of the Commission proposal unamended. The Council agreed its negotiating mandate on 23 June 2023. On 6 July 2023, the co-legislators reached a political agreement on ASAP, and Coreper confirmed the provisional agreement the following day. The deal was endorsed in Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) on 9 July. On 13 July the act was adopted in plenary. The final act was signed on 20 July and published in the Official Journal on 24 July. The ASAP comes in response to Ukraine's request for assistance with the supply of 155 mm-calibre artillery rounds, and the agreement of the Council on 20 March 2023 on a three track proposal on ammunition. Member States were invited to urgently transfer ammunition from their own stocks to Ukraine (Track 1). They agreed to jointly procure 1 million ammunition rounds (Track 2). Track 3 aims at ramping up production capacity in the European defence industry. This is supposed to be achieved through the ASAP, which responds directly to the Council's call to deliver ammunition urgently, and if requested missiles too, to Ukraine and to help Member States restock their supplies.

    "title": "Towards gender balance in the European elections: Electoral quotas \u2013 What can they achieve?",
    "summary": "Gender-balanced representation among the decision-makers of the European Union is an important step towards full realisation of the principle of equality between women and men enshrined in the EU Treaties. The Union has made steady and significant progress, starting from a very low presence of women among EU Commissioners and Members of the European Parliament at the time when those institutions were created. The European Parliament is today one of the world's most gender-balanced representative assemblies, but there are still significant divergences between EU countries. Several EU countries elect men and women in almost equal numbers, but others are still far away from such a balance. In this context, analysing the tools that have allowed some Member States to fill the gender gap is instrumental for further progress. One tool stands apart in bringing about change in the most straightforward way: electoral quotas. Quotas can speed up progress significantly, but they are neither an indispensable nor a sufficient instrument for securing balanced political representation. Some countries do well without quotas, while others which do have quotas are still lagging behind. To be effective, quotas must be designed to match the electoral system, and need to be reinforced by rank-order rules. They need to be applied by political parties in a substantive and not merely a formal way, and flanked by other measures to encourage greater participation by women in politics and to induce a change of political culture leading to a more women-friendly environment. Effective sanctions for non-compliance matter, too. Voluntary party quotas are an additional tool and they can also be meaningfully applied in countries with binding quotas. The European Parliament has drafted a legislative proposal to support, among other things, a binding objective of gender balance for European elections, but so far the Council has not endorsed it. This briefing is one in a series of publications ahead of the 2024 European elections.",

Recent shocks have shown not only how vulnerable to crises the single market is, but also the extent to which the EU economy relies on a well-functioning single market. It is now considered to be a key driver of EU resilience. In September 2022, the Commission put forward a single market emergency instrument (SMEI) package. It includes one main proposal for a regulation establishing a SMEI, and two accompanying proposals amending harmonised product legislation to ensure that strategic goods can be marketed quickly to address shortages in the event of market crises. The main proposal establishes measures for contingency planning, such as an early warning system. A 'vigilance mode' could be activated after a threat has been identified. If a wide-ranging crisis hits the single market, an 'emergency mode' could be triggered. The proposal is now in the hands of the co-legislators. In the European Parliament, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) is responsible for the file. It adopted its report on 18 July 2023.

    "summary": "Following the backsliding in democratic standards that occurred after the unsuccessful coup of 2016 and the Council of the European Union's June 2018 decision ruling out the opening of any new EU accession negotiation chapters, accession talks with T\u00fcrkiye are frozen. The disputes in the eastern Mediterranean that involved some Member States, as well as the military engagement of T\u00fcrkiye in Syria, provided additional tensions in relations with the EU in 2019 and 2020. In February 2020, the Commission did not mention T\u00fcrkiye in its communication on the accession process setting out its new enlargement methodology. Since December 2020, a relative reduction in tension in the eastern Mediterranean has allowed the EU to re-engage with Ankara on important areas of cooperation, including modernisation of the customs union, in line with the 2016 EU-T\u00fcrkiye statement, despite no advances on this specific issue. Some progress in EU-T\u00fcrkiye relations has been achieved through High-level Dialogues that are held alongside regular EU-T\u00fcrkiye Summits; however, the High-level Dialogue meetings on energy remain suspended. Following the re-election of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in May 2023, the European Council conclusions of 29-30 June invited the High Representative and the Commission to submit a report to the European Council on the state of play of EU-T\u00fcrkiye relations. In recent years, the EU has made certain EU funds accessible to T\u00fcrkiye, including through the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA). In addition, in 2022 the EU established the T\u00fcrkiye Investment Platform to support economic growth, innovation and green investment. Furthermore, substantial refugee assistance was delivered under the EU's humanitarian and development aid instruments, mainly through the EU Facility for Refugees in T\u00fcrkiye (2016-2019) and additional refugee funding mobilised by the EU in 2020-2023. Finally, following the February 2023 earthquakes, the EU, Member States and international donors provided humanitarian aid as well.",

The package included a proposal for a regulation to ensure a level playing field for sustainable air transport, also known as the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. The proposed regulation obliges fuel suppliers to distribute sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), with an increasing share of SAF (including synthetic aviation fuels, or e-fuels) over time, in order to increase the uptake of SAF by airlines and thereby reduce emissions from aviation. It also obliges airlines to limit the uptake of jet fuel before departing from EU airports to what is needed for safe operation of flights, with the aim of ensuring a level playing field for airlines and airports, and avoiding additional emissions relating to the extra weight of aircraft carrying excessive amounts of fuel. In the European Parliament, the file was referred to the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) as the lead committee. The Committees on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) and on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) were associated under Rule 57.

    "summary": "When an EU resident makes an investment in securities in another Member State, the payments received in return (dividends or interest) are normally subject to a withholding tax in the country of the investment (source country), before being subject to tax in the resident's country. In order to eliminate double taxation, the investor has to submit a refund claim on the excess tax withheld by the source country. Today, however, these relief procedures are cumbersome, unharmonised, and often paper-based. This discourages investors from making investments in another EU Member State, to the detriment of capital markets union and growth of EU businesses. The system also leaves room for fraudsters to claim refunds on taxes they never paid in the first place. To address this issue, the European Commission tabled the FASTER proposal on 19 June 2023. Under the proposal, Member States would be given a choice between applying either a 'relief at source' system and/or a 'quick refund' system, with both procedures accelerating and facilitating withholding tax relief for the investor, thereby promoting cross-border investment in the EU. In addition, a number of safeguards to stop tax abuse, in particular cum-ex fraud, are introduced. The proposal is subject to the special legislative procedure, requiring unanimous support in Council, following consultation of the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee.

    "summary": "The European Parliament set up its Transparency Register in 1995, in response to criticism regarding the transparency and accountability of the EU's decision-making process in the context of widespread lobbying of the EU institutions. The Commission followed suit in 2008. The two institutions merged their instruments in a joint European Transparency Register in 2011 on the basis of an interinstitutional agreement (IIA); the Council remained only an observer at that time. This original Transparency Register was a voluntary system of registration for entities seeking to influence the EU decision-making process. Following a political review, a new improved registration system was introduced in January 2015. However, Parliament continued to call for a mandatory register for lobbyists interacting with the EU institutions, to ensure better standards for lobbying and more transparency. The Parliament, Council and Commission eventually agreed an Interinstitutional Agreement on a Mandatory Transparency Register, which entered into force on 1 July 2021. This time, the Council became a signatory to the agreement rather than just an observer. The new IIA is based on the conditionality principle and introduces other new features, including a reinforced structure for the follow up and management of the IIA. While introducing some principles to enhance a common culture of transparency, the IIA leaves the three signatories to implement the conditionality and subsequent complementary measures as they see fit. This updates and expands on a briefing of May 2016, by Marie Thiel and Elisabeth Bauer.",

Every flag state must ensure that its registered fleet complies with international standards on safety, pollution prevention, and working conditions, through inspections and surveys. This is considered the first line of defence in ensuring that EU flag states discharge their international law obligations with respect to ships flying their flags. The current proposal would cover requirements for flag state inspections, based on International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules. The objective is to improve maritime safety and reduce the risk of environmental pollution, ensuring that EU flag states continue to provide high quality shipping services. The proposal facilitates information sharing between flag states on the results of inspections and compliance issues in general. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) is to support this cooperation through revised training programmes for flag state inspectors. The Transport and Tourism Committee (TRAN) is leading the European Parliament's work on this legislative file. The Committee on Fisheries (PECH) will prepare an opinion. First edition. The 'EU Legislation in Progress' briefings are updated at key stages in the legislative procedure.",

    "title": "Revision of the Port State Control Directive",
    "summary": "On 1 June 2023, the European Commission presented a legislative package to modernise and reinforce maritime rules on safety and pollution prevention. This package contains proposals for the revision of five legal acts, among them the Port State Control Directive (PSCD). The aim is to update these acts so that they are in line with the requirements of the International Maritime Organization and the regional organisation for port state control established under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The directives should also harness the potential offered by new technologies. The proposal for a revision of the PSCD, which is the specific topic of the present briefing, focuses on port state control (PSC) \u2013 one of the two pillars of maritime safety \u2013 the other one being compliance with flag state rules. PSC is the inspection of foreign ships in national ports to verify that the ships' condition complies with international regulations, including for crews. The PSCD would be extended to cover additional international rules, such as new conventions on ballast water and removal of wrecks, as well as updated rules under the Paris MoU. It would attach greater importance to the environmental performance of ships in determining their risk profile. Additionally, it would boost the Member States' capacity to detect and address cases of non-compliance with standards and rules on safety, environmental protection and pollution prevention. The scope of the directive would be extended to fishing vessels, and PSC-related operations would need to be digitalised. Within the European Parliament, the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) is leading the work on this legislative file. The Committee on Fisheries (PECH) has been invited to provide an opinion.

    "title": "Understanding the EU's response to illicit drugs",
    "summary": "The EU is an important market for illicit drugs (hereinafter referred to as drugs), both in terms of consumption and production. An estimated 29 % of European adults aged 15-65 have used drugs at least once in their lifetime, the majority of them being men. Cannabis remains by far the most used drug, followed by cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy or molly) and amphetamines. Drugs have been claiming an increasing number of lives in the EU since 2012, but their impact goes far beyond the harm caused by their use. The drugs market is the largest criminal market in the EU, with an estimated minimum retail value of \u20ac30 billion per year in the EU alone. Over a third of the organised crime groups active in the EU are involved in the trade in drugs, which, besides generating massive criminal profits and inflicting substantial harm, incites associated violence. Drug markets furthermore have links with wider criminal activity, including terrorism; they have a negative impact on the legal economy and communities, cause environmental damage and can fuel corruption and undermine governance. Drugs have been trafficked into and through the EU for decades, but they are also increasingly produced in the EU, for both local and global markets, as is the case for cannabis and synthetic drugs such as amphetamines. In fact, the trade in synthetic drugs in the EU is unique compared to other substances, as the production of these drugs and new psychoactive substances in most cases takes place in the EU. In 2021, around 1 million seizures of drugs were reported in the EU-27 plus Norway and T\u00fcrkiye. Although the EU Member States carry the primary responsibility for developing their drug policy and legislation, cross-border cooperation is paramount in the fight against drugs. With the problem constantly expanding in scale and complexity, the EU has been increasingly active since the early 1990s, particularly with respect to law enforcement, health-related issues and the detection and risk assessment of new psychoactive substances. This is an update of a briefing published in September 2021.",

In the meantime, Russia's invasion of Ukraine confirmed the key role of space for defence and resilience, but also highlighted vulnerabilities related to space systems. Another 'wake-up call' came from a different direction; SpaceX's advances in reusable rocket technology leading to Starship's first orbital flight test turned the spotlight onto launch providers and access to space. Space is a critical infrastructure issue with growing economic significance. It is also an increasingly contested arena between competing geopolitical interests. To address these rising challenges, in March 2023 the European Commission and the High Representative/Vice-President presented their first joint communication on a European space strategy for security and defence.",

    "title": "EU protein strategy",
    "summary": "The EU is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products, thanks to its common agricultural policy (CAP). However, the EU livestock sector is critically dependent on imports of plant-based proteins for animal feed, especially soybeans, from Argentina, Brazil and the United States (US). The links between protein imports and deforestation, on the one hand, and the substantial greenhouse emissions (GHG) from animal farming, on the other, are also lending greater prominence to the use of plant-based proteins in human nutrition. The European Union (EU) has long aimed to reduce its protein import dependency, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated the need to shield EU agriculture from price volatility and trade disruptions. At their informal meeting in Versailles of March 2022, EU leaders identified 'increasing the EU production of plant-based proteins' as a means to improve the EU's food security and reduce food prices. Further to this high-level political declaration, the European Commission is expected to review its protein policy in the first quarter of 2024, reviving hopes for a comprehensive EU protein strategy. Some of the proposals being considered to close the EU's protein gap include encouraging the domestic production of protein-rich crops, which have received substantial support in the CAP national strategic plans for the 2023-2027 period. Diversifying the available protein sources for food and feed is another way of reducing the EU's deficit. These sources include microbial, insect and seaweed proteins. Finally, greater efficiency and circularity in the way food is produced and consumed would also contribute to the EU's protein self-sufficiency and to mitigating the environmental footprint of its agri-food sector. The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) has prepared a draft report on a European protein strategy (rapporteur: Emma Wiesner (Renew, Sweden). Some 716 amendments to the draft report have been submitted ahead of the vote in the AGRI committee.",

Linking the study to the Normandy Index, which measures threats to peace and democracy worldwide based on the EU Global Strategy, each chapter of the study analyses a specific threat to peace, and presents an overview of EU action to counter the related risks. The areas discussed include proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, democracy support, conflict prevention and mitigation in fragile contexts, the security impacts of climate change, cyber-attacks, disinformation, and terrorism, among other issues'. A parallel paper, published separately, focuses specifically on the state of play of the EU's relations with Iraq.

This implementation appraisal first outlines the existing EU legislation on ship-source pollution and penalties for infringement before reviewing and summarising the evaluation produced by the Commission. Overall, evaluations found Directive 2005/35/EC only partly effective, despite its having contributed to the establishment of a legal framework that enables easier prosecution of polluters and having played a key role in the creation of CleanSeaNet, a system developed by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to detect potential pollution events. The proposed revision aims to align the directive with other EU legislation, notably Directive (EU) 2019/883 on port reception facilities. The revision also aims to incorporate the full range of pollutants under the International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). The revision also aims to remedy issues that arise throughout the detection, verification, reporting and penalisation process of pollution incidents. While CleanSeaNet enabled more targeted and effective controls by Member States, the latter's lack of reporting on how they followed up on alerts remains problematic. In addition, despite the existence of a legal framework that allows the penalisation of ship-source polluters, the evaluation found that dissuasive penalties are rarely imposed.",

Within the EU, these are regulated through the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which sets rules for payment services, their providers and consumer protection. Announced in September 2021 under the digital finance strategy and the retail payments strategy, the Commission published two proposals on the revision of PSD2 on 28 June 2023 as part of the financial data access and payments package. This implementation appraisal first outlines PSD2 before reviewing and summarising evaluations and assessments of its implementation already conducted by EU institutions and their advisory bodies. Overall, PSD2 is found to have contributed to the development of the European payments market and to have improved customer protection and the efficiency, transparency and choice of payment instruments. However, shortcomings pertaining to regulatory deficiencies regarding new players and services in the payments market, divergences in implementation across Member States and unclear alignment with other EU legislation remain. The proposal to revise PSD2 comprises a proposal for a directive on payment services and electronic money services (PSD3) and a proposal for a regulation on payment services in the internal market (PSR). These proposals include both payment services and electronic money services, which were previously regulated separately. With the forthcoming revision, the Commission aims to harmonise the implementation of rules on payment services across Member States, align the legislation with market and technological developments, strengthen customer protection and improve the level playing field between bank and non-bank payment service providers.",

The IA presents a clear intervention logic and a seemingly comprehensive qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the seven policy options proposed, from which it derives a preferred set of options. The comparison of the environmental, economic, social and consumer impacts of the different policy options (including sub-options) relies inter alia on the results of a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The IA is specific about the costs that businesses would incur in the context of the OIOO approach. Overall, the proposed directive appears to reflect the preferred set of options identified in the IA. The entire IA draws to a large degree on a supporting study focusing on economic and behavioural analysis, the methodology of which is described in detail in Annex 4. However, despite over 100 direct references to that 'IA study', the IA does not provide access to the supporting study (not even a bibliographic reference), nor does it justify why the study is not disclosed, which goes against the transparency requirements set out in the BRG.",

    "title": "Roma and Sinti Holocaust: Recognition, education and justice",
    "summary": "On 27 January 1945, the Soviet Army liberated the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp. Held on this date since 2002, International Holocaust Remembrance Day is a solemn occasion to commemorate the Jewish, Roma and Sinti victims of Nazi terror. Following a resolution of the European Parliament, a distinct European Roma Holocaust Memorial Day is marked every year on 2 August to commemorate the Roma uprising on that day in 1943, when prisoners of the 'Gypsy Camp' there fought almost bare-handed the SS soldiers ordered to exterminate them. Despite these two, or even more, events commemorating the Roma and Sinti Holocaust, marked every year in some countries, the history of the genocide of these groups is widely unknown. The number of Roma and Sinti victims \u2013 estimated at between a quarter and a half of their pre-war populations \u2013 is difficult to define, as the survivors were not properly taken care of after the liberation of their camps, and they lacked knowledge of their rights. This situation resulted in decades of ignorance of this historic fact, and its belated recognition. International bodies such as the Council of Europe, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, and the Documentation and Cultural Centre of German Sinti and Roma, as well as the EU institutions, have developed strategies and tools to include Roma and Sinti Holocaust education in school curricula and to promote commemoration ceremonies. The initiators of these strategies hope that recognition of the Roma Holocaust and its roots in discrimination will help stop violence towards Roma and Sinti people in the future and promote their inclusion. This publication updates and expands a January 2020 'at a glance' note.",

    "summary": "As Ukraine continues its counter-offensive against the Russian invaders, the NATO summit in Vilnius vowed unwavering support for the country, and took decisions to simplify its path towards membership of the Western military alliance. NATO leaders said they would be able to invite Ukraine to join the Alliance once the country meets certain conditions. They declared continued support for Ukraine\u2019s deterrence and defence in the short, medium, and long term, as well as for turning the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) into a multi-year programme for Ukraine. This assistance will help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and move Ukraine towards full interoperability with NATO. The NATO summit declarations fell short of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s expectations for receiving a clearer path to enter the Alliance. However, he praised NATO\u2019s decision to scrap the need for Kyiv to complete a preparatory Membership Action Plan to join NATO. The Alliance and Ukraine also held the inaugural meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council to manage the relationship, which reaffirmed that 'Ukraine's future is in NATO'. On the summit's side-lines, Group of Seven (G7) developed countries unveiled an international framework to boost Ukraine's long-term security against Russia. A number of other military packages were announced at bilateral meetings between Zelenskyy and individual NATO leaders. This note gathers links to the recent publications and commentaries from many international think tanks on Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. Earlier analyses on the war can be found in a previous edition of \u2018What Think Tanks are Thinking\u2019.

    "summary": "In absolute figures, the Danish National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) is the sixth smallest national plan (or third smallest as a share of gross domestic product, GDP) under the unprecedented EU response to the crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Denmark's requested Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) allocation consists solely of the non-repayable grant (see figure below). Denmark was initially set to receive a \u20ac1 551.4 million grant allocation from the RRF, which corresponds to 0.2 % of the entire RRF and to 0.5 % of Denmark's 2019 GDP. The country's NRRP totals \u20ac1 615 million, which means that Denmark will add the difference in national funding. In June 2022, the maximum grant allocation available for Denmark was revised downwards to \u20ac1 429 million (-7.9 %). According to Article 18 of the RRF Regulation, measures under the NRRPs are to be completed by 2026. Denmark has so far received 32.4 % of the resources in the form of pre-financing and one payment; this is above the EU average. A further five payments will depend on progress made in implementing the plan. On 31 May 2023, Denmark sent the European Commission a request to revise its NRRP, to include a REPowerEU chapter on energy measures for which additional grant resources worth \u20ac131 million are available. The European Parliament, which was a major advocate for the creation of a common EU recovery instrument, participates in interinstitutional forums for cooperation and discussion on its implementation and scrutinises the European Commission's work. This briefing is one in a series covering all EU Member States. Second edition. The 'National Recovery and Resilience Plans in the EU' briefings are updated at key stages throughout the lifecycle of the plans.",

    "summary": "The protection of animals at the time of slaughter is regulated at EU level by Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009. The regulation states that all animals should be stunned prior to having their throats cut. However, in order to ensure that some religious communities can consume meat in accordance with their precepts, and on the basis of the fundamental right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, a possible derogation from the stunning obligation may be applied. While it is up to individual Member States to decide whether to use this derogation, or to prohibit outright the slaughter of animals without stunning, the procedure is the subject of ongoing discussion and concern. While some groups see slaughter without stunning as a threat to animal welfare, religious groups defend their freedom to express their faith and recognise respect for animal welfare as a fundamental basis of their beliefs. According to scientific evidence, both methods of slaughter, with and without stunning, have critical points. In addition, the interpretation of scientific evidence, and that of religious beliefs, is part of the debate.",

The assessment of the options' impacts (economic, social and environmental) is qualitative and quantitative and appears to be based on sound research and analysis. The IA provides a comprehensive summary of the costs and benefits of the preferred set of options for the affected stakeholder groups.

    "summary": "Freshwater is a vital yet scarce resource that is under increasing threat. Progress towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) 6 (ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all) is off track globally, and many of its targets will not be reached by 2030. Access to freshwater and sanitation is alarmingly challenged in several African and Asian regions. While for the most part the European Union (EU) has abundant freshwater compared to other parts of the world, it is increasingly exposed to water stress in terms of frequency and areas affected, with climate change predicted to further reduce water availability in some parts of its territory. Pollution remains a major source of pressure on EU water bodies. Across the world, the nefarious impact of climate change and pollution intensifies competition for scarce freshwater resources. This results in occasional conflicts but also in initiatives for better-coordinated management. Such initiatives serve as a powerful tool for the upward shift in gears pledged by the UN member states, in particular at the UN World Water Conference held in March 2023. EU legislation and supporting tools cover a wide range of issues relevant to the implementation of SDG 6. Several EU environmental acts are now being revised to get them aligned with the European Green Deal policy objectives, notably on pollution prevention, reduction and control. Those revisions have the potential to propel the EU further towards the achievement of SDG 6. The adoption of the EU Water Framework Directive inspired a number of third-country initiatives, and the Convention on transboundary watercourses and lakes initiated in Europe in 1992 is now open for accession to all UN member states. While striving for further progress at home, the EU supports third countries in improving their access to freshwater, sanitation and hygiene services. The European Parliament and other EU institutions repeatedly underline that access to water is a human right and endeavour to harness this right in the EU's internal and external policies.",

This study analyses how this inclusive approach by the EFSD+ is being applied in practice. It examines data on implementation of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), EFSD+\u2019s predecessor, to present the challenges and opportunities of using reimbursable aid for promoting inclusive development. Data analysis is further complemented with case studies on concrete investments in three EU partner countries: Ghana, Jordan, and Zambia. Information available on the functioning of the EFSD+ Open Architecture, including a list of Proposed Investment Programmes, is then analysed to shed light on how the EFSD+ inclusive approach improves upon that of the EFSD. This analysis focuses on the allocation of funds across sectors, countries and channels, as well as the definition and measurement of inclusive development outcomes, along with the prevention of unintended negative impacts. It is concluded that inserting the EFSD+ into EU aid\u2019s overall programming is enhancing its inclusive approach, but actual results still need to be produced and reported. The study concludes with some recommendations for the European Parliament to use its scrutiny capacities to improve still further the reporting of the EFSD+ inclusive development outcomes.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis have placed a huge strain on everyone's mental health. The restrictive measures taken by governments during the pandemic had a severe impact on people, with inequalities in mental health, both within the population and between social groups. Young people, the elderly and people in vulnerable situations suffered more than others. Mental health is also an issue at work. Poor working environments, including excessive workloads, job insecurity, harassment and discrimination, pose a risk to the mental health of workers. Policies and services addressing mental health are the individual EU Member States' responsibility. The EU work on mental health, part of its activities on non-communicable diseases, aims to complement Member States' policies, supporting real action on the ground and the exchange of best practice and knowledge. On 7 June 2023, addressing calls from the European Parliament and from citizens in the context of the Conference on the Future of Europe, the European Commission adopted a communication on a new comprehensive approach to mental health, adding another pillar to the architecture of the European Health Union. EU action on mental health will focus on three guiding principles: access to adequate and effective prevention; access to high quality and affordable mental healthcare and treatment; and reintegration into society after recovery. The European Parliament has always been a supporter of the promotion of good mental health and putting mental health at the heart of EU policymaking. Its Subcommittee on Public Health (SANT) is currently preparing an own-initiative report on mental health.",

    "summary": "Adopted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \u2013 'the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all' \u2013 clearly links 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to a series of targets to be reached by 2030. The 2030 Agenda includes a detailed mechanism for monitoring progress towards these targets. At its core are a number of quantified indicators for each target, which are regularly revised by the UN and other international agencies. These agencies and the EU provide support to national statistical services across the world in collecting data for the SDG indicators in order to gather reliable and comparable datasets. The data feed into the voluntary national reports that countries prepare to exchange best practice and advice on tackling the challenges they encounter in implementing their SDG strategies. Every year, a high-level political forum on sustainable development (HLPF) takes stock of both progress and weaknesses in implementation. Based on the reporting and the conclusions of the HLPF, every 4 years an SDG summit \u2013 the next one coming up in September 2023 \u2013 makes recommendations and pledges to undertake a number of actions to accelerate progress. The EU Statistical Office (Eurostat) has solid experience in collecting consistent data from the EU Member States. Together with a set of specific indicators created by Eurostat, these data give a good overview of the EU's progress towards the SDGs. Moreover, the EU services for international partnerships have set up a framework of indicators to assess how EU support contributes to other countries' implementation of the SDGs. At this year's HLPF, the EU is presenting its first voluntary review, giving an overview of the EU policies' and initiatives' contribution to progress towards each of the SDGs at EU and global levels. Although technical in nature, SDG indicators and data also have a political dimension, as they clearly measure countries' and other stakeholders' achievements against their own commitments.",

    "title": "EU Energy Platform: Facilitating joint purchases of gas",
    "summary": "In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU took immediate action to stem rising energy prices and secure energy supply to its Member States. In its communication on the REPowerEU plan from March 2022, the European Commission proposed that the Member States use joint purchasing, collecting of orders and matching of supply and demand to support gas storage refilling operations. The Commission also proposed a 'joint European platform' to lead bilateral negotiations with major gas producers. Accordingly, the EU Energy Platform was established on 7 April 2022, initially on the basis of a European Council mandate. The legal basis for the platform is Council Regulation (EU) 2022/2576 of December 2022, which lays down the rules for the joint purchasing mechanism. The latter is to remain in operation for 1 year as of the moment the document enters into force and the service provider in charge of the joint purchasing mechanism is selected. The EU Energy Platform aims to ensure security of supply by purchasing natural gas, LNG and hydrogen for the Member States jointly and at affordable prices, after aggregating their demand (at least 15 % of the Member States' storage filling obligations are subject to demand aggregation). Once a Member State submits a demand, it is under no obligation to actually purchase gas; from that moment on it is for energy companies \u2013 from within the EU and the EU Energy Community \u2013 to negotiate and make business decisions. Natural gas and LNG demand from these companies is aggregated and then matched with reliable EU or non-EU sellers. This happens through AggregateEU \u2013 a demand aggregation and joint purchasing service operated by a service provider chosen by the Commission based on predefined criteria. The EU Energy Platform is also in charge of the outreach to international suppliers with a view to diversifying gas supplies. The evolution of the platform will depend on the political will and readiness of the Member States to pool a larger part of EU gas demand. Major gas-consuming countries in particular would have to be convinced to give away their privileged market access in order to build a common and effective mechanism. In the long run, the platform could shift its focus towards hydrogen procurement and distribution to accelerate the energy transition towards renewable sources.",

Since January 2023, Lula has deployed a number of recycled but updated policy tools from the early 2000s, which, it is assumed, will deliver similarly positive results in curbing deforestation as in the past. However, times have changed. Amid an underwhelming economic outlook and a weak political power base, Lula and the environmentalist members of his government face an uphill battle to put Brazil on a path to zero deforestation by 2030 and to reconcile this aim with the need to boost economic growth to reduce poverty and inequality. Tangible progress will take time to emerge given the damage caused during the past four years.",

    "summary": "On 14 March 2023, the European Commission proposed a reform of the EU electricity market, with the aim of reducing price volatility for consumers and creating favourable conditions for investors in low-carbon energy. The reform includes two legislative proposals \u2013 one on electricity market design (EMD) and the other on protection against wholesale energy market manipulation (REMIT). The reform would improve consumer protection by offering more fixed-priced contracts and enhancing supplier obligations, and incentivises solutions such as energy communities, self-consumption and renewable energy sharing. It would support the use of more long-term instruments such as power purchase agreements and contracts for difference, and improve integration and liquidity in forward markets. It also enhances flexibility solutions such as demand response and storage. Furthermore, it aims to improve market monitoring and transparency, and protection against manipulation. The draft reports are scheduled to be voted in the ITRE committee on 19 July (EMD) and 7 September (REMIT), respectively. Both reports would then be tabled for plenary in September. Second edition.

Over time, food markets have evolved substantially, driven by innovation and changes in consumer demand and expectations. Taking this shift into account, on 21 April 2023 the European Commission proposed to update some of the rules governing a set of directives on food products \u2013 the 'breakfast' directives \u2013 including the marketing standards they introduced. The revision also echoes key messages of the EU's 'farm to fork' strategy, which addresses the challenges of sustainable food systems and recognises the strong links between 'healthy people, healthy societies and a healthy planet'. Changes include modifying the definition of marmalade, cutting sugar in fruit juice and introducing stricter origin labelling for honey and clearing the way for the manufacture of lactose-free evaporated milk. In their feedback, most stakeholders focused on honey labelling, voicing disappointment with the proposal's lack of ambition and calling for indicating each country of origin, in descending order, and its respective share of honey.

    "summary": "Sovereign states, as the primary subjects of public international law, voluntarily enter into treaties (international agreements) creating international organisations, as the secondary subjects of public international law. According to a long-standing and well-established principle of public international law, known by the Latin maxim of pacta sunt servanda, states are obliged to abide by the agreements to which they commit. This principle is enshrined in Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ('Vienna Convention'). It also applies, as a matter of course, to the multilateral treaties establishing international organisations. Such treaties may specify duties incumbent upon state parties, such as periodic payment of membership fees or agreement to abide by the decisions of organs of the organisation, as well as a set of values or principles to which state parties to the founding treaties have voluntarily committed, as in Article 3 of the Statute of the Council of Europe. If a state violates a provision of a multilateral treaty that is essential to the accomplishment of its object or purpose, under Article 60 of the Vienna Convention, such breach is considered material. In such case, the other parties may, by unanimous agreement, suspend the operation of the treaty in whole or in part, or terminate it either in the relations between themselves and the defaulting state, or between all the parties to the treaty. Some experts claim that Article 60 of the Vienna Convention could be invoked to terminate a treaty establishing an international organisation, and thereby serve as a means for suspension or expulsion of a recalcitrant member.",

    "summary": "The European Union (EU) has established over 40 regimes of sanctions against third countries, entities, and legal and natural persons. These restrictive measures include arms embargoes, import and export bans, freezing of funds and economic resources, and travel bans. Whereas the adoption of EU sanctions is centralised at EU level, their implementation and enforcement lies with the Member States. The significant differences between national systems, particularly in terms of offences and penalties for breaches of EU sanctions, are thought to weaken their efficacy and the EU's credibility. Following the Council's decision to add the violation of EU sanctions to the areas of 'particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension', the European Commission issued, in December 2022, a proposal for a directive to harmonise criminal offences and penalties for such violations. On 9 June, the Council adopted its general approach. In the European Parliament, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted its report on the proposal on 6 July 2023, along with a decision to enter into trilogue negotiations.

    "summary": "Several EU directives dealing with equality require EU Member States to establish equality bodies with a focus on assisting victims of discrimination and preventing and fighting discrimination on the grounds listed under the directives. However, their rules are too general and have no precise definition of these bodies' duties and manner of operation, thus leading to disparities among the Member States' bodies. Additionally, the work of some Member States' bodies has been hampered by lack of resources, insufficient independence or a narrow remit. In 2018, the European Commission adopted a recommendation on standards for equality bodies. Later, after assessing its implementation, it decided to shift to binding legislation. In a package of legislative measures on equality, in December 2022 it published a proposal setting standards for equality bodies fighting discrimination on several grounds. A second proposal, under the ordinary legislative procedure, focuses specifically on equality between men and women in the employment field. The proposal reinforces the equality bodies' independence, resources and mandate. While generally welcoming the proposal, stakeholders have suggested specific changes to its provisions.

    "title": "EU nature restoration regulation: Setting binding targets for healthy ecosystems",
    "summary": "As announced in the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, on 22 June 2022 the European Commission tabled a proposal for a nature restoration regulation. The proposed regulation would set multiple binding restoration targets and obligations across a broad range of ecosystems, from forests and agricultural land to urban areas, rivers and marine habitats, complementing other existing legal instruments. Altogether, these nature restoration measures should cover at least 20 % of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050. Member States would be required to develop nature restoration plans to reach these targets at national level; the Commission would assess these plans. While nature restoration enjoys strong public support, the proposal has raised concerns among stakeholders as regards the enforceability and achievability of the targets, the economic and social implications, the protection of property rights and the financial support for restoration. In Parliament, there was no majority in favour of the proposed regulation as amended in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), responsible for the file. The committee was therefore bound to table to plenary a proposal to reject the Commission's text. Parliament now has to take a position. The Council adopted its general approach on 20 June 2023.

    "summary": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan won a third term in office in elections in May, after years of growing authoritarianism in his secular Muslim country which is also a NATO member state. His presidential track record includes growing conflict with the European Union and United States, as well as unorthodox economic policies that have recently undermined people's living standards. After his victory in a run-off vote, Erdo\u011fan promised an assertive foreign policy and a return to normalised economic policies. Public finances are currently in tatters after high pre-election spending. Some analysts say this may have helped Erdo\u011fan to win the ballot, along with a lack of independent media. The appointments of liberal economists in the nearly fully reshuffled cabinet have raised hope that T\u00fcrkiye will return to a more normal monetary policy and try to overhaul its economy, partly with the aim of attracting foreign investors. On the political front, T\u00fcrkiye continues to block Sweden's accession to NATO, claiming that the Scandinavian country harbours activists which Ankara regards as terrorists. This note gathers links to publications and commentaries from many international think tanks on the implications of Erdo\u011fan's victory.

There are 17 goals on a variety of topics, with SDG7 dedicated to energy. The annual UN High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) will discuss progress on the goals on 10 19 July 2023, with energy as one of the five goals chosen this year for an in-depth review. The European Union has taken steps to link the SDGs with its policymaking. The von der Leyen Commission has committed to integrating the SDGs across EU policies, in line with its comprehensive approach. Eurostat has been publishing monitoring reports on SDG progress in the EU since 2017, while reporting on SDGs in EU countries has been part of the European Semester since 2019. This year the European Commission prepared the first-ever EU voluntary review of EU internal and external action towards the SDGs, to be presented at the UN HLPF in July 2023. The EU focuses its SDG7 action on energy consumption, energy supply and access to affordable energy. Indicators monitoring progress include energy efficiency, the share of renewables in energy consumption, energy import dependency and energy poverty. EU policies and legislation address many of these areas, thus contributing to the achievement of SDG7. These include the Energy Efficiency Directive, Renewable Energy Directive, the REPowerEU plan, measures on energy demand reduction and curbing energy prices. To support SDG7 worldwide, EU external action is conducted under initiatives such as the Global Gateway strategy, Neighbourhood Development and International Cooperation Instrument \u2013 Global Europe, and energy partnerships with third countries. While progress on SDG7 is advancing, meeting the ambitious targets for 2030 will require more effort, especially in terms of efficiency improvements, boosting renewables and ensuring access to clean and affordable energy.",

    "title": "Understanding SDGs: The UN's Sustainable Development Goals",
    "summary": "In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to be attained by 2030. Unlike their antecedents, the SDGs commit both developed and developing countries, and embrace the economic, environmental and social aspects of development. The SDGs and the broader 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, of which they form the core, are based on findings that human activities have triggered dramatic changes in the conditions on Earth (climate change and biodiversity loss), which in turn have contributed to the deterioration of human wellbeing. To reverse the trend, there was an urgent need to simultaneously address the multiple causes and consequences of environmental depletion and social inequalities. To this end, it is necessary to develop synergies between the SDGs and manage the trade-offs between them. Challenges in pursuing the SDGs include the fact that countries do not necessarily have an equal starting point and, even more importantly, that regardless of their stage of development, they can no longer afford to apply the current development model, where production and consumption happen at the expense of natural resources. According to many observers, this model creates unsolvable tensions between SDGs, notably between the safeguarding of natural resources and the aspirations for improved wellbeing. Halfway to the 2030 deadline, progress towards the SDGs is insufficient or, in some cases, has even gone into reverse. The structural transformation that would bring about the needed acceleration requires a joint push by the international community, but an equally strong one by individuals and public or private legal persons. The European Union was a leader in drafting the SDGs; it is also a frontrunner in mainstreaming the SDGs in all its policies. At the high level political forum on sustainable development coming up in July 2023, the EU will present a detailed review of its achievements and plans for each SDG. The European Parliament regularly assesses the EU commitments on achieving the SDGs. This further updates an earlier briefing; the first edition of which, by Marta Latek and Eric Pichon, was published in December 2019.",

    "summary": "The EU blacklist of high-risk jurisdictions for money laundering is being criticised for a lack of autonomy from the FATF lists, politicisation and lobbying, and lack of transparency. The paper shows four ways to change this. More autonomy from the FATF can be reached through grey listing or merging the EU money laundering list with the EU tax list. More transparency can be reached by involving NGOs or academics to do the listing. But all these lists only look at the framework of anti-money laundering policy. When looking at the actual behaviour of launderers, criminological findings should be included. This can be accomplished by leveraging various agencies, like the US International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) list. Lists differ substantially from each other and cover more than half of the world. To achieve both autonomy and transparency and to prevent politicisation, a research institute similar to the IMF could be established, for example, in the newly planned anti money laundering agency AMLA. Here an encompassing alert system of money laundering, including persons, sectors, entities, and countries could become an EU support for Member States. \r\nThis document was provided by the Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies at the request of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON).",

The study outlines the dangers and effects of climate change in the EU as well as the EU policies and mechanisms to deal with climate change disasters. A theoretical framework is developed to determine appropriate compensation mechanisms to deal with climate change disasters. Also, the compensation mechanisms for natural disasters in a representative selection of Member States are discussed. Furthermore, a critical analysis of the compensation mechanisms at EU and Member State level is provided, and policy recommendations are formulated.",

    "summary": "The European Green Deal envisages a review of measures addressing pollution from large industrial installations, with a view to aligning existing legislation with the EU's zero pollution ambition, as well as its energy, climate and circular economy policy goals. On 5 April 2022, the European Commission tabled a proposal to revise the Industrial Emissions Directive, the main European Union instrument regulating pollutant emissions from industry, together with a proposal to revise the Regulation establishing the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, related to environmental information. The proposal aims at upgrading the existing register to a more comprehensive and integrated industrial emissions portal, enabling more accurate monitoring of the environmental performance of large industrial activities. The main changes proposed include better alignment with the Industrial Emissions Directive, both in terms of activities covered and reporting level; inclusion of reporting on the use of resources; and integration in the database of additional relevant environmental data reported under other related EU legislation. In Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), responsible for the file, adopted its report on 24 May 2023. The report awaits a vote in plenary during the July 2023 session. If adopted, it would form Parliament's position for negotiations with the Council. Second edition.

In terms of digitalisation, the proposed update of the requirements for representing designs would allow applicants to file new digital design types (e.g. by using 3D printing technologies). In terms of efficiency, the proposals aim to make the application procedures cheaper and simpler, the registration procedures faster, while also ensuring greater predictability and legal certainty for individual designers, SMEs and design-intensive industries looking for design protection in the EU. Within the European Parliament, the files have been assigned to the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI), with Gilles Lebreton as rapporteur. The draft reports on the Community Design Regulation and the Design Directive were published on 15 June 2023. The deadline for tabling amendments is 12 July 2023.

In 2019, the World Health Organization declared antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to be one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. On 26 April 2023, the European Commission published a proposal for a Council recommendation on stepping up EU action to combat AMR. This proposal complements two other legislative proposals, together making up the EU pharmaceutical package. It provides for a holistic preparedness and response framework to curb AMR, through a One Health approach, ensuring the inclusion of human, animal and plant health, as well as their interactions with the environment. Three main priorities underpin the proposal: infection prevention, prudent use of antimicrobials (including the objective of reducing human consumption of antibiotics in the Union by 20 % by 2030), and research and development to ensure access to appropriate medical countermeasures. The European Parliament adopted a resolution welcoming the proposal on 1 June. The Council of the EU adopted the recommendation on 13 June 2023.",

On 25 March 2020, the Council decided to open accession negotiations with the country, based on its progress in meeting the political criteria and fulfilling the five priorities that are key for EU membership. Accession negotiations effectively started in July 2022, when the first intergovernmental conference was held. The main challenges are flaws in the functioning of the judiciary, in the fight against corruption, and in the safeguarding of media freedoms and minority rights. The Parliament's position on the European Commission's 2022 annual report on Albania is due to be voted in plenary in July 2023.",

    "title": "Future of Sino-Afghan relations: Impacts on EU interests and strategic autonomy",
    "summary": "The Taliban takeover of Kabul on 15 August 2021 and Western forces' subsequent complete withdrawal did not bring peace and stability to Afghanistan. Levels of violence may have decreased throughout the country, but the Taliban remain neither capable of sustaining the Afghan economy, nor of efficiently combating terrorist groups on their territory. After two decades of military involvement and trillions of dollars invested, and due to the Taliban's broken promises and its violations of the 2020 Doha Agreement, it remains highly unlikely that Western governments, including within the European Union, will have the capacity and political will to invest in Afghanistan beyond the provision of humanitarian assistance. This leaves the door open for other players to broker security deals with the Taliban, and exploit Afghanistan's largely untouched resources. One of these could be China. Unlike other regional players, China is a world-leading economy with a strong and undisputed presence on the international stage. For the Taliban, China could therefore bring financial investments and political legitimisation. For China, a friendly, secure, and stable Afghanistan would be a valuable addition to its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a token of stability for its Xinjiang region, and would help in asserting its regional dominance in Central Asia. For the EU, the future of Sino-Afghan relations looks rather bleak. An expansion of Chinese investment in Afghanistan would strengthen the Chinese monopoly on many rare earth material and infrastructure networks in Central Asia. Conversely, restrained involvement would contribute to severely limiting economic and political development in the country, opening the door for transnational terrorist groups to flourish and threaten international security.",

    "title": "Sustainable food systems - Pre-legislative synthesis of national, regional and local positions on the European Commission's initiative",
    "summary": "This briefing provides a pre-legislative synthesis of the positions of national, regional and local governmental organisations on the European Commission's forthcoming proposal on sustainable food systems. It forms part of an EPRS series offering a summary of the pre-legislative state of play and advance consultation on a range of key European Commission priorities during its 5-year term in office. It seeks to present the current state of affairs, examine how existing policy is working on the ground, and identify best practice and ideas for the future, from governmental organisations at all levels of the European system of multilevel governance. EPRS analysis of the positions of partner organisations at European Union (EU), national, regional and local levels suggests that they would like the following main considerations to be reflected in the discussion of the forthcoming proposal on sustainable food systems. * Sustainability is being prioritised in many governmental policies. There are a number of national, regional and local policies and strategies making the connection between the environment and food and food production. * Measures are being put into place to boost the economic potential of food-related sectors and to contribute to regional development. Local and regional food systems can enhance the economic potential of EU regions. Investment in research and innovation in food-related industries is vital for the future of sustainable food systems. * Food has an important social and health dimension. An increasing number of measures are being taken to provide healthier food for wider sections of the population and to improve the working conditions of people working in food-related industries. * The COVID-19 epidemic, the war in Ukraine and fears of climate change are highlighting the issue of food security. Food also has an important geopolitical dimension. Food quality and food safety are issues of increasing concern. * The EU plays an important role when it comes to generating policies related to food systems. A number of EU funds covering food activities also contribute significantly to agriculture, rural and regional development. More financial support is necessary to tackle numerous challenges. * National, local and regional governments are active in creating sustainable food systems and aspire to do more in this area. Regional and local governments have considerable expertise and knowledge to offer in developing sustainable food systems.",

    "title": "Revising the Energy Efficiency Directive: 'Fit for 55' package",
    "summary": "On 14 July 2021, the European Commission adopted the 'fit for 55' package with a view to adapting existing EU climate and energy legislation to meet the EU objective of a minimum 55 % reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, as required under the European Climate Law. The 'fit for 55' package includes a recast of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), aligning its provisions to the -55 % GHG target. The current EED is designed to meet the existing goal of 32.5 % energy efficiency improvements by 2030. The recast EED as proposed by the Commission required Member States to almost double their annual energy savings obligations, make exemplary efforts in the public sector, address energy poverty, and take other measures to deliver 9 % more energy savings than anticipated under existing EU legislation. As part of the REPowerEU plan (May 2022) to address the ongoing energy crisis, the Commission proposed a targeted EED amendment requiring 13 % more energy savings by 2030. The trilogue negotiations concluded on 10 March 2023 with a provisional agreement, setting a reduction target for primary and final energy consumption of 11.7% at EU level by 2030 compared with energy consumption forecasts made in 2020. The ITRE committee and Coreper endorsed the text on 24 April and 29 March 2023 respectively. The next step is the final adoption in plenary and in the Council, both expected in July 2023. Fourth edition of a briefing, the first two editions of which were drafted by Alex Wilson. The 'EU Legislation in Progress' briefings are updated at key stages throughout the legislative procedure.",

    "title": "The EU wine sector",
    "summary": "The European Union is the world's largest producer, consumer and exporter of wine. It accounts for half of the world's production, with three quarters of EU wine produced in Spain, France and Italy. The EU had 2.2 million vineyard holdings in 2020, varying in size from an average of 0.2 hectares in Romania to 10.5 hectares in France. The EU also accounted for 48 % of global wine consumption in 2021, with the largest overall consumption recorded in France, Italy and Germany. Globally, only the United States consumed more wine than any of these three countries. EU wine policy is as old as the common agricultural policy (CAP). The principal legislation in the sector is the Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation, which contains rules on numerous aspects of winemaking. Among other things, these rules govern wine sector product definitions, oenological practices, vine planting authorisation schemes, labelling and presentation, and geographical indications. The CAP Strategic Plans Regulation, the CAP Horizontal Regulation, and a plethora of delegated and implementing acts also apply. The complex policy framework also includes other legislation, such as the Food Labelling Regulation and the Organic Production Regulation. EU wine producers today face numerous challenges. Hit by the closure of the hospitality sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sector has also suffered from unfavourable weather conditions due to climate change, which is expected to require substantial changes in the way wine is produced in the future. EU winemakers face increasing competition from other parts of the world, as well as the changing preferences of consumers, who are increasingly opting for wines with less alcohol and wine produced and packaged in sustainable ways. The changing legislative framework at EU and national levels also brings new challenges.",

    "title": "Replacement of individual Commissioners",
    "summary": "On 15 May 2023, following national elections in Bulgaria and after receiving the institutional mandate to form a new government in her home country, Mariya Gabriel formally submitted her resignation, with immediate effect, as European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth. That resignation was accepted by the Commission's President, Ursula von der Leyen. For the interim period, she has asked Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager to take over responsibility for overseeing the innovation and research portfolio, and Vice-President Margaritis Schinas to take over the education, culture and youth portfolio. Subsequently, the procedure to replace Gabriel has started. In June 2023, the Bulgarian government proposed two candidates to replace her: Ms Iliana Ivanova and Mr Daniel Lorer. On 28 June, following interviews with both candidates, von der Leyen announced she had chosen Ivanova, a former Member of the European Parliament (during the 7th parliamentary term), currently serving as a member of the European Court of Auditors. She will be responsible for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, the same portfolio as held by Gabriel. The European Parliament will be consulted \u2013 with the competent committees (ITRE and CULT) planning a hearing, before a plenary vote \u2013 opening the way to her formal appointment as Commissioner for the remainder of the current term.

    "title": "Geopolitics in the Indo-Pacific: Major players' strategic perspectives",
    "summary": "The Indian Ocean hosts some of the fastest growing economies in the world and connects these economies with both the Atlantic Ocean and the Asia-Pacific region, making the Indo-Pacific a region of tremendous geostrategic importance. For over a decade, China has been increasing its maritime presence and its ambitions in the region and beyond. With the development of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013 and renewed tensions between China and Taiwan, China's territorial claims and its artificial islands in the South China Sea, the security dynamic in the region has shifted. India has expressed significant concern regarding China's increased presence in the Indian Ocean and China's bolstered relations with Pakistan. In response, India has reinforced its participation in the United States-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) and in the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). India has also adopted a new defensive approach. The US has also demonstrated unease regarding China's actions, in particular with its 'debt-trap diplomacy' and its assertive tone on Taiwan. The US has not only expressed these concerns at the bilateral level, but also at the international level, for example through NATO's Strategic Concept. Caught in the crossfire of three strategic perspectives lie the sea trade routes that connect the Middle East, Africa and east Asia with Europe and the US, over which the majority of the world's maritime oil trade and nearly one third of total worldwide trade passes. Along this route there are crucial passage points, which, if obstructed, could potentially bring the world economy to a standstill. The EU's position on China, its second biggest trading power, has remained broadly unchanged since March 2019. In the March 2022 Strategic Compass, the EU alluded to China's increased assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific, expressing serious concerns. The EU presented its first strategy for the Indo-Pacific on 16 September 2021.",

    "title": "Safety of ro-ro passenger ships: Stability requirements",
    "summary": "In the framework of the Commission's Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT) and Better Regulation agenda, and as announced in the 2011 White Paper on Transport, the Commission presented a legislative proposal to amend existing rules on damage stability requirements for roll on roll off (ro-ro) passenger ships, known as ferries. This is to improve the maritime safety of both vessels and their passengers. The revision of the existing directive originates from maritime accidents, such as the MS Estonia in 1994 and the MS Express Samina in 2000. It would ensure consistency with the applicable international standards, recently updated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) under its 2020 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). It also aims to strengthen the fleet entry requirements within the EU for large vessels that have not yet been certified here. The proposal will amend the existing Directive (2003/25/EC) in this area. The main purpose is to align current technical rules with IMO stability requirements, and to simplify these rules. Negotiators for the Parliament and Council reached a provisional agreement on the proposal in December 2022, after which it was formally adopted by Parliament in plenary on 14 March 2023 and subsequently by Council on 25 April. The final act was published in the Official Journal on 15 May 2023, and Member States have until 5 December 2024 to transpose it into national law. Third edition.

The European Commission's proposal for a revision, tabled in April 2022, seeks to bring it into line with the EU's zero pollution ambition, energy, climate and circular economy policy goals under the European Green Deal. The main changes include expanding its scope, strengthening permit requirements, and adding measures to foster innovation. Stakeholders' reactions are mixed: industry and farming representatives are concerned about the proposal's added complexity, timeliness and practical implementation. Non-governmental organisations criticise the missed opportunity to make the directive fit for climate protection, and the proposed new regime for intensive livestock rearing.

    "title": "Monitoring the EU's economic recovery: Economic growth stalls as monetary tightening bites",
    "summary": "After an unexpectedly strong economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU now faces the difficult task of bringing down inflation \u2013 mainly caused by sharp increases in energy and food prices in 2022 \u2013 while sustaining economic growth and investment in strategic areas such as the green and digital transitions. Economic growth in the EU has declined since mid-2022 and nearly stalled, while the euro area endured a mild technical recession. At the same time, in 2022, annual inflation in the EU reached the highest level ever measured, at 9.2 %, more than triple the 2021 level of 2.9 %. Central banks made unprecedented interest rate increases \u2013 referred to as 'monetary policy tightening'. This approach is starting to show its effect on inflation, with May 2023 data indicating a drop to 7.1 %, from 8.1 % in April. However, monetary policy tightening has worsened financing conditions, while raising tensions on financial markets and reducing growth. At the same time, labour markets have proven particularly resilient, with unemployment rates at historic low levels, underscoring a record tight labour market. This points to a build-up of wage pressure, while evidence suggests that corporate profits have contributed more than half of recent domestic price pressures. After reaching a historic peak in 2020, the levels of public debt \u2013 defined as debt to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio \u2013 declined significantly in a majority of Member States, and by 8 percentage points on average across the EU. The economic outlook shows several interconnected risks, such as the effects of monetary policy tightening combined with tighter macroeconomic policies that could add to financial stability vulnerabilities. In such an environment, policy responses need careful calibration, as policy coordination in the EU remains limited. In that context, this publication, the third in a series updated twice a year, aims to track the state of the EU economy and trends in the recovery. It also provides a snapshot of the deployment of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery instrument launched in 2021. Its main tool for investment and reform, the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), can now also finance new REPowerEU chapters focused on energy, with the aim of ending the EU\u2019s dependence on Russian fossil fuels and accelerating the energy transition.",

The CPR, which provides a common technical language to assess the performance of construction products, enables Member States to define the legal requirements for construction works. On 30 March 2022, the Commission put forward a proposal to revise the CPR. The proposal is part of a package with several other sectoral proposals aimed at making sustainable products the norm in the EU and boosting circular business models. The stated aims of the proposal are to improve the functioning of the internal market for construction products, address the implementation challenges that still exist at national level (particularly regarding market surveillance), simplify the legal framework and support the green and digital transition in the sector. In Parliament, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) is responsible for the file.

With the adoption of conclusions on China, the European Council chose to display unity and stress its political will to forge a common approach based on the concept of 'de risking \u2013 not de-coupling from China'. As anticipated, migration became a very divisive point, with two countries, Hungary and Poland refusing to endorse joint conclusions, which were replaced by conclusions of the European Council President. In addition, EU leaders addressed a range of external relations topics, including the Western Balkans accession process, the situation in Kosovo, the Cyprus settlement and relations with Turkey following the re-election of President Erdogan, with the High Representative/VP and the Commission invited to report on the state of play. EU leaders also discussed relations with the Southern Neighbourhood, welcoming the partnership package with Tunisia, and prepared for the July 2023 EU-CELAC Summit aimed at renewing the EU partnership with Latin America, a priority for the incoming Spanish Council Presidency.",

    "summary": "On 19 June 2023, the EU and Kenya concluded negotiations on an economic partnership agreement (EPA). This agreement builds on negotiations for an EPA with the partner states of the East African Community (EAC) \u2013 at the time: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda \u2013 which were finalised in October 2014. However, the signing of the EU-EAC EPA had been stalled because of discussions within the EAC on the consequences of the EPA for their economies. Except for Kenya, all EAC partner states are least developed countries, and still enjoy duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market. Kenya is the only EAC country to have ratified the agreement, in order not to lose free access to the EU market. The EAC initially envisaged the EU-EAC EPA as a bloc-to-bloc agreement \u2013 i.e. the EPA could only enter into force after it had been ratified by all EAC partners. However, the EAC eventually agreed that Kenya enter negotiations to implement a bilateral EPA with the EU. Other EAC countries \u2013 including South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which joined the EAC in 2016 and 2022 respectively \u2013 can decide to join the agreement. As soon as the EU-Kenya EPA enters into force, it will immediately provide duty-free, quota-free EU market access to all exports from Kenya, combined with partial and gradual opening of the Kenyan market to imports from the EU. The text of the new negotiated agreement includes binding provisions on trade and sustainable development, and a transparent dispute resolution mechanism. Third edition.

It argues that, despite the different conditions and context at the time, it is possible to draw lessons from this first enlargement experience on how applicant states can create favourable conditions for their stable long-term integration into the present-day European Union. Governments, political parties and societal groups need to define their expectations of the economic benefits of EU membership realistically. This was the case in Ireland and Denmark, which rightly expected to benefit from the common agricultural policy and \u2013 in the case of Ireland \u2013 significant fiscal transfers. It was not the case for the UK, however, leading to a negative collective experience of the economic realities of membership during the economic slump following the 1973 oil crisis. Politically, moreover, the UK was ill prepared for cooperative patterns of politics and policy-making in the EC/EU. Large sections of the British elites and citizens saw the world in a binary divide between those ruling and those being ruled. EC membership could easily be portrayed as mediating the UK's transition from a position of ruling to one of being ruled by an allegedly new imperial centre, 'Brussels'. By contrast, EC membership gave the Irish an institutionalised European voice. Sharing formal sovereignty for them enhanced their actual independence from the UK. Denmark, finally, over time developed a pragmatic approach to sharing sovereignty. This briefing also highlights the importance of defending the aim of EU membership with realistic and convincing narratives. The creation of a broad domestic consensus on the desirability of membership, and preparation for its economic and political implications, are crucial for shaping a trajectory towards stable long-term integration into the EU. This briefing follows up a roundtable event organised by EPRS on 26 April 2023, which included contributions by N. Piers Ludlow, London School of Economics, Brigid Laffan, European University Institute, and Morten Rasmussen, Copenhagen University.",

    "title": "Strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs)",
    "summary": "On 27 June 2023, the Legal Affairs Committee (JURI) adopted its report on the proposal for a directive concerning the protection of journalists and human rights defenders from abusive civil proceedings. The Commission's proposal of 27 April 2022 came in response to a legislative initiative of Parliament. The JURI committee supports the proposal, and has put forward a number of amendments seeking to strengthen it. Once approved in plenary, the report will form the basis for trilogue negotiations with the Council, which adopted its general approach on 9 June 2023. The main changes to the Commission proposal set out in the JURI report include the introduction of a minimum harmonisation clause, expansions of the definitions of abusive court proceedings and public participation, and a wider scope for the cross border element, necessary to trigger the directive. People engaged in public participation would enjoy a right to information, legal aid, financial assistance and psychological support. There would be national registers of anti-SLAPP court decisions, and a Union-wide register run by the Commission. New rules on conflict of laws and jurisdictions would determine the courts having jurisdiction and the applicable law. Member States would be obliged to set up 'one-stop shops' composed of national networks of specialised lawyers, legal practitioners and psychologists to offer guidance, information and protection, including legal aid, financial and psychological support, to people targeted by abusive litigation. The topic of SLAPPs would have to form part of legal profession training, in order to raise awareness of abusive proceedings and the remedies available under the directive. Third edition. The first and second editions were written by Micaela Del Monte and Maria D\u00edaz Crego. The 'EU Legislation in Progress' briefings are updated at key stages throughout the legislative procedure.",

    "title": "Victims' rights in the EU: Revision of Directive 2012/29/EU",
    "summary": "This briefing is one in a series of implementation appraisals produced by the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) on the operation of existing EU legislation in practice. Each briefing focuses on a specific EU law that is likely to be amended or reviewed, as envisaged in the European Commission's annual work programme. Implementation appraisals aim at providing a succinct overview of publicly available material on the implementation, application and effectiveness to date of specific EU law, drawing on input from EU institutions and bodies, as well as external organisations. They are provided by the Ex-Post Evaluation Unit of the EPRS to assist parliamentary committees in their consideration of new European Commission proposals, once tabled. Directive 2012/29/EU (the Victims' Rights Directive) establishes minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime and ensures that persons who have fallen victim to crime are recognised and treated with respect. It also ensures that victims receive proper protection, support and access to justice. The Victims' Rights Directive has had a positive effect where implemented. However, the European Commission 2020 evaluation of the directive recognises, there are shortcomings when it comes to its practical implementation by Member States. These shortcomings originate, for example, from the lack of specificity in some of the directive's provisions. For instance, inadequacies in the provision of specialised expertise to meet specific victims' needs, and in victims' access to relevant information on their rights. The revision of the Directive is part of the 2020 2025 EU strategy on victims' rights. This revision aims at strengthening the rights of victims of crime throughout the EU. The scope of the revision includes improving access to information and support for victims, ensuring that victims are treated with dignity and respect throughout criminal proceedings, and enhancing their rights to participate in them. Additionally, the revision aims at better protection for victims of gender-based violence, including sexual violence and domestic abuse, and to address the needs of vulnerable victims, such as children and persons with disabilities.",

    "title": "Revision of Regulation (EC) 1406/2002 establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency",
    "summary": "In its 2020 sustainable and smart mobility strategy, the European Commission announced several legislative revisions in the domain of maritime safety, including on the regulation founding the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), which was adopted in 2002 and amended several times. The Commission proposal for the revision of the EMSA Founding Regulation was adopted as part of the maritime safety package on 1 June 2023. This implementation appraisal first outlines the existing EU legislation on EMSA before reviewing and summarising existing evaluation and discussion of its implementation, produced by EU institutions and their advisory bodies. Overall, the evaluations and reports on the implementation of the agency's founding regulation confirm EMSA's effectiveness and added value in providing a high level of maritime safety, and response capacity in maritime accidents and pollution caused by ships, as well as oil and gas installations. The agency acts as a centralised source of technical, operational and scientific assistance to the European Commission, Member States, and third countries sharing a regional basin with the EU, in the maritime safety and security domain. With the forthcoming revision, the Commission aims to align EMSA's mandate with the agency's growing role in supporting maritime sector sustainability and digitalisation, as well as updating its tasks in the light of evolving security challenges at sea, including cybersecurity, hybrid threats and the surveillance of the Black Sea region as a consequence of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, for example. Moreover, the revision looks to end the distinction between EMSA's core and ancillary tasks. The proposed revision also considers the agency's additional tasks that will result from parallel legislative developments in maritime safety. These include two proposals in particular, for the extension of the emissions trading system (ETS) to maritime transport and for the FuelEU Maritime initiative within the Fit for 55 package.",

    "summary": "Council Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive) was adopted in 1992 with the aim of protecting over a thousand animal species and preventing 230 habitat types from disappearing. Human activities in recent decades have caused large carnivore numbers to decline significantly, with complete disappearance in some areas. The recovery and return of these carnivores was one of the targets of the EU Habitats Directive; but this objective has not been without controversy, especially where economic activities have suffered damage from the reintroduction of certain species. While the European Commission and the Member States have some tools to mitigate economic losses, discussion is ongoing to find a good compromise to ensure both the survival of large carnivores and the continuation of professional activities. This briefing summarises the level of protection of large carnivores across EU Member States, as well as the protective measures currently available to farmers. It reflects the different points of view of the stakeholders concerned, and the ongoing discussions within the EU institutions. This briefing has been drafted following a request from a member of the European Committee of the Regions, under the cooperation agreement between the Committee and the European Parliament.",

    "summary": "On 28 September 2022, the European Commission proposed a revision of the 2009 Directive on the protection of workers from the risk of exposure to asbestos. The aim of the proposal is to lower the occupational exposure limit (OEL) value, which is mandatory in all Member States. According to the proposal, the OEL would be reduced from 0.1 fibres/cm\u00b3 to 0.01 fibres/cm\u00b3, and not to a lower limit as wished by the European Parliament and some European trade unions. Despite the total ban on the use of asbestos in the EU, exposure to this carcinogenic fibre, which is still present in millions of buildings, kills more than 70 000 people a year in Europe. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted its report on the proposal on 26 April 2023. The mandate to enter trilogues was endorsed by the plenary the following month. On 27 June 2023, the Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement, which now needs to be confirmed, and formally adopted by the two co-legislators. First edition.

    "summary": "On 5 April 2022, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on fluorinated greenhouse gases that would repeal Regulation (EU) No 517/2014. The proposal is amongst the last from the 'fit for 55' package, aiming to align EU climate and energy laws with the EU Climate Law's 2030 target. The proposal aims to further reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases). It would change the existing quota system, gradually reducing the supply of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) to the EU market to 2.4 % of 2015 levels by 2048. It would also ban F-gases in specific applications and update the rules on implementing best practices, leak checking, record keeping, training, waste treatment and penalties. The current licensing system and labelling obligations would be strengthened in order to improve enforcement of trade restrictions. Finally, the proposal would align EU legislation with the requirements of the Montreal Protocol to reduce production of HFCs. Parliament referred the file to its Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), which adopted a report on 1 March 2023. On 30 March 2023, MEPs adopted their position, with 426 votes in favour, 109 against and 52 abstentions, with few changes to the Committee's report.

    "summary": "As part of the 'fit for 55' package, the Commission proposed a revision to the EU's emissions trading system (ETS) as regards carbon dioxide emissions from aviation. The proposal sought to ensure that the sector contributes to the EU's climate targets through increased auctioning of allowances, with an end to free allowances from 2027, and by applying the linear reduction of aviation allowances. The proposal would also integrate, into the revised ETS, the International Civil Aviation Organization's agreed global market-based Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and apply it to international flights departing from or arriving at an airport inside the European Economic Area (EEA). For domestic flights in the Member States or flights within the EEA, the ETS would continue to apply.

    "title": "Reinforcing the European defence industry",
    "summary": "Russia's war on Ukraine has laid bare the challenges that the European defence industry faces as it tries to meet increased demand and ramp up production in the wake of a fundamentally changed security environment in Europe. The European defence industry comprises a number of large multinational companies, mid-caps and over 2 000 small and medium-sized enterprises. It faces a multitude of challenges, such as decades of under-investment, fragmentation, lack of supply of critical raw materials and semiconductors, and a lack of manufacturing capability. The EU and its Member States have taken several steps to reinforce the European defence industry, especially since the start of Russia's war on Ukraine: Member States have significantly boosted their defence budgets, the combined total of which is set to reach \u20ac290 billion a year in 2025; the European Defence Fund is investing in research and capability development projects and has achieved very positive results so far; and Permanent Structured Cooperation is providing the legal framework and binding commitments for important progress in collaborative defence. The EU has also broken taboos by proposing a joint defence procurement instrument (European Defence Industry Reinforcement through Common Procurement Act) and an initiative to ramp up ammunition production (Act in Support of Ammunition Production), as part of a three-track proposal to support Ukraine's needs for ammunition (deliver ammunition from existing stocks, jointly procure from industry, and support the ramping up of production). Additionally, the European Peace Facility, most known for being used to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons, can be used to procure defence materiel from the European defence industry, further boosting its capacity. The European Chips Act and Critical Raw Materials Act will also be leveraged to benefit the European defence industry to ensure that it has all the necessary supplies to tackle the substantially increased demand for its products. These signals have led the industry to take the first steps to ramp up its production capacity.",

    "summary": "Leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will meet in Vilnius on 11-12 July against the backdrop of a complex and volatile security environment. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, and the latter country\u2019s future membership of the military alliance will dominate the annual summit, according to many public statements. The meeting will aim to send a strong signal of support for Ukraine, reiterating NATO\u2019s open door policy towards the country's membership, increasing military aid, pledging to make the Ukrainian military more interoperable with NATO forces and, possibly, outlining future security guarantees for Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is seeking a commitment that his country will join NATO as soon as the war is over, but only some Allies support that request, while others are more cautious. NATO leaders will discuss creating a new NATO-Ukraine Council, which would boost relations between the two, compared with the current NATO-Ukraine commission. NATO will also address strengthening its eastern flank, updating the Alliance\u2019s current plans to defend the region from possible Russian aggression. NATO will also re-examine its Strategic Concept adopted last year in Madrid, discuss security challenges posed by China, and the required increases in the member states\u2019 defence spending. Allies are expected to press T\u00fcrkiye to drop its opposition to Sweden\u2019s membership of NATO. NATO countries hope to find a replacement for, or prolong the term of, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is formally due to step down in September.

    "summary": "Most products are not designed with their life cycle environmental impacts in mind, and it is difficult for consumers and economic operators to make sustainable choices when buying products. The EU still lacks an overarching legislative framework laying down rules for sustainable production and consumption of all products. Ecodesign refers to the integration of environmental sustainability considerations into the characteristics of a product, and into processes throughout its value chain. On 30 March 2022, the European Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation establishing a framework for setting ecodesign requirements for sustainable products. The proposed regulation would lay down rules applying to all products on the internal market, with the aim of making them more durable, reusable, reparable, upgradable, recyclable and generally less harmful to the environment. The regulation would include rules on a digital product passport, green public procurement and banning the destruction of unsold goods. The Council adopted its position on the proposal on 22 May 2023. In the Parliament, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) is the lead committee. A total of 1 136 amendments were tabled in ENVI. The vote on the draft report took place in ENVI on 15 June 2023. The report was adopted with 68 votes in favour, 12 against and 8 abstentions. It is due to be voted in plenary in July 2023, thus setting Parliament's position for trilogue negotiations. Second edition of a briefing originally drafted by Nikolina \u0160ajn.

    "title": "The European Council President and the EU's external representation: (Inter)action in times of war in Europe",
    "summary": "Russia's military aggression against Ukraine has brought war back to Europe, altering the security equilibrium. The war has placed Ukraine at the centre of the European Council's agenda and debates. The European Council President is in regular contact with the Ukrainian leadership, multiplying visits to Ukraine and references to the war in his speeches delivered abroad. This has also been the approach of the other two key actors in the EU's external representation: the European Commission President, and the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission (HR/VP). However, this has not led to more cooperation or cohesion in the EU's external representation, as the three actors have carried out their tasks individually rather than jointly, and barely ever interact outside international summits. The Lisbon Treaty allows for parallel action in the EU's external representation, and the resulting reality is often competition between the different actors. Furthermore, the vagueness of the Lisbon Treaty provisions allows the various actors to (re)shape their external representation roles, often at the expense of the others. Mediation, a task the European Council President, Charles Michel, has taken upon himself with the Armenia-Azerbaijan dialogue, is a case in point.",

    "summary": "The European Commission tabled a proposal for an EU regulatory framework on artificial intelligence (AI) in April 2021. The draft AI act is the first ever attempt to enact a horizontal regulation for AI. The proposed legal framework focuses on the specific utilisation of AI systems and associated risks. The Commission proposes to establish a technology-neutral definition of AI systems in EU law and to lay down a classification for AI systems with different requirements and obligations tailored on a 'risk-based approach'. Some AI systems presenting 'unacceptable' risks would be prohibited. A wide range of 'high-risk' AI systems would be authorised, but subject to a set of requirements and obligations to gain access to the EU market. Those AI systems presenting only 'limited risk' would be subject to very light transparency obligations. The Council agreed the EU Member States' general position in December 2021. Parliament voted on its position in June 2023. EU lawmakers are now starting negotiations to finalise the new legislation, with substantial amendments to the Commission's proposal including revising the definition of AI systems, broadening the list of prohibited AI systems, and imposing obligations on general purpose AI and generative AI models such as ChatGPT.

    "title": "European streaming platform for national news accessible in all EU languages: Technical feasibility study",
    "summary": "The development of a European digital public space in which all European citizens could inform themselves about current affairs would be a great opportunity. While online platform operators from the United States and China provide various different digital media and also meeting spaces, these often lack democratic discourse and at the same time increase polarisation and division by concentrating and rewarding those types of content that generate outrage. Freedom of expression, and the possibility to access qualitative and trustworthy content from across the entire EU, and beyond, are essential to secure European democracies, ensuring that all EU citizens are well informed by offering them a broad spectrum of high quality, publicly available content. To enable such a setup, high-quality European broadcasters, including many public broadcasters, and media companies, and later also non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders, including citizens, would have to be supported in sharing broadcasts and other types of media-related content and data, as well as in developing innovative solutions. The development of a European streaming platform that taps into exactly these sources could provide a multilingual focal point that bundles together all high-quality European news broadcasts in one platform, enabling EU citizens to discover these programmes and also to consume them, without language barriers, in multiple languages, using sophisticated AI-based language technologies including automatic speech recognition (for the transcription and indexing of content including metadata generation, subtitling and captioning), machine translation (for the translation of subtitles) or, say, even automatic speech-to-speech translation (for the fully automated generation of dubbed programmes). A crucial aspect of such a platform is that it must not be vulnerable to external manipulation attempts. This diverse set of artificial intelligence technologies for processing the audiovisual content and for providing fair and balanced search, discovery and recommendation mechanisms, would enable, for the first time, communication across language barriers on the scale of a whole continent. This study assesses the technical feasibility of the implementation of such a European streaming platform.",

    "summary": "The video games sector is the fastest growing cultural and creative sector in Europe, with an estimated European market size of \u20ac23.3 billion in 2021. A highly innovative digital sector, it directly employs more than 90 000 people in Europe, and continues to generate new employment opportunities for many creators, including game developers, designers, writers, and music producers. Half of all Europeans consider themselves to be video game players; of these, almost half are women. An essential part of the video games phenomenon is e-sports: competitions, often hosted in large venues, where teams and individuals compete on video games in front of live audiences. However, there is currently no coherent strategy for the legal treatment of e sports either at the EU level or in most Member States. In recent resolutions, the European Parliament has called on the Commission and the Council to acknowledge the value of the video game and e-sport 'ecosystem' in the EU by developing a long-term European video game strategy. Parliament has also stressed that video game players need to be better protected from manipulative practices and potentially addictive game design features. The European Union has launched several initiatives to better understand and develop the video games sector, in particular under the Horizon Europe research and innovation funding programme and the Creative Europe programme.",

    "summary": "'Rainbow families' \u2013 same-sex couples with or without children \u2013 still face many obstacles while exercising their free movement rights today. In a debate in the European Parliament in September 2010, then European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship, Viviane Reding, stated, 'Let me stress this. If you live in a legally recognised same-sex partnership, or marriage, in country A, you have the right \u2013 and this is a fundamental right \u2013 to take this status and that of your partner to country B. If not, it is a violation of EU law, so there is no discussion about this. This is absolutely clear, and we do not have to hesitate on this'. Over a decade later, same-sex couples still experience issues when relying on their free movement rights. While the European Court of Human Rights has upheld that all member countries must provide for a registered partnership for same-sex couples if they do not provide for same-sex marriage, it can be unclear which rights should be attached to such a status. And while the European Court of Justice has ruled that same-sex marriages and parenthood established for same-sex couples have to be recognised in all EU Member States for the purpose of free movement, this case law is still very unclear, due to mixed concepts, which has led to consistent Member State violations. In her 2020 State of the Union Speech, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated 'If you are [a] parent in one country, you are [a] parent in every country'. In 2021, the European Parliament declared the EU an LGBTIQ Freedom Zone. It has expressed its deepest concern regarding the discrimination suffered by rainbow families and their children in the EU and insists that the EU needs to take a common approach to the recognition of same-sex marriages and partnerships. In December 2022, the Commission proposed a regulation on the recognition of parenthood.",

    "summary": "Midway of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the High-Level Political Forum 2023 marks a pivotal point in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The impact of the multiple crises of the past years, as well as the interlinkages and synergies of the SDGs present both challenges and opportunities for a systemic approach towards our common objectives. For the global community not to lose the progress in this global decade of action, there is a need for the EU to take the lead, both in domestic policies and international cooperation. Conclusions from the Eurostat Monitoring Report 2023, Sustainable Development Report 2022 and civil society analysis point to the EU\u2019s progress on social-economic SDGs, and notes insufficient progress on environmental objectives and global partnerships. Thus, there is a strong need for policy coherence, financing frameworks and political will to ensure the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the objectives set out in the Paris Climate Agreement.",

    "summary": "China, the United States, and the European Union are global rivals in areas covering trade, geopolitics, the military, economics, and technology. Economically, China's rise as a global player has disrupted the traditional dominance of the US and the EU. China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to expand the country\u2019s economic influence by investing in infrastructure projects across many regions, challenging the economic interests of the US and the EU. For several years, US trade policy has aimed to prevent China from becoming the global technological leader, notably in the area of green transition and artificial intelligence (AI). Washington is encouraging the EU to follow a similar policy, and the Union is becoming increasingly wary of its economy being dependent on exports from some other regions. In April, the European Parliament called for clarity and unity in policy towards China. EU leaders, divided in their approach to China, will hold a strategic debate on China at the European Council meeting on 29-30 June. The clash between different ideologies exacerbates the rivalry, with the US and EU representing democratic values and China pursuing an authoritarian model. Despite the rivalry, the three powers also face common challenges such as climate change, necessitating a delicate balance between competition and collaboration. This note offers links to recent reports and commentaries from some major international think tanks and research institutes on the global rivalry of the three regional powers. It focuses on politics, the economy and technology. \u2018What think tanks are thinking\u2019 will focus on the military aspect of this competition and China\u2019s attitude to Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine in future editions.",

Drugs are an increasingly complex security, social and health problem that affects millions of people in the European Union (EU) and globally. The drug market generates huge profits for organised crime, and is estimated to be the source of approximately one fifth of global crime proceeds. The EU is considered an important market for drugs, in terms of both consumption and production. Over a third of the organised crime groups (OCGs) active in the EU are involved in the drugs trade. The fight against drugs is therefore a priority for the EU and its Member States.",

    "summary": "In 2016, with unprecedented numbers of irregular migrants and asylum-seekers arriving in the EU, the European Commission proposed a package of reforms to the common European asylum system (CEAS). In June 2018, a broad provisional agreement was reached between the European Parliament and the presidency of the Council of the EU on several of the reform proposals. However, the agreement did not get the necessary support from the Member States. The reform stalled owing to persistent disagreements among the Member States on how to apply the principle of solidarity in practice and share their responsibilities in the area of asylum in a fair manner. In September 2020, the Commission sought to revive the reform by putting forward a new pact on migration and asylum, offering a comprehensive approach aimed at strengthening and integrating key EU policies on migration, asylum and border management. The pact builds on and amends the previous reform proposals. In line with the gradual approach proposed by the French Presidency of the Council in June 2022, the Member States reached agreement on several aspects of the reform relating to the screening and registration of migrants arriving at the EU's external borders. Following an agreement in the Council in June 2023 on two key proposals, the negotiations between co-legislators can resume on most of the files, with the aim of finalising the reform of the EU migration and asylum system before the next European elections, in June 2024.

    "title": "Revising the fisheries control system",
    "summary": "At the political trilogue meeting of 30 May 2023, the co-legislators reached agreement on revising the EU fisheries control system. The new legislation is a complete overhaul of the current system. It amends five regulations, of which Council Regulation (EC) 1224/2009 (the Control Regulation) forms the core of the EU fisheries control system. The deal is the result of a long process. In May 2018, the Commission tabled the proposal as the last major component of the 2013 revision of the common fisheries policy. The European Parliament and the Council adopted their positions in March and June 2021 respectively, after which interinstitutional negotiations started. The agreement was reached during the twelfth political trilogue meeting. Some of the main changes introduced by the proposal and supported in the agreement include tracking of all fishing vessels, electronic reporting of all catches, monitoring of recreational fisheries, improving (digital) traceability along the supply chain and harmonising sanctions across the EU. On control of the landing obligation via on-board closed-circuit television cameras for vessels at high risk of non compliance, the co-legislators agreed that this provision would only apply to vessels of 18 metres length or more. Parliament and Council also agreed on more flexibile tolerance margins as regards catch weight estimates on board, in particular for small pelagic and tuna species. The agreement is scheduled to be put to a vote in the Parliament's Committee on Fisheries meeting of 27 June 2023, after which the text of the agreement would need to be formally adopted by the Parliament and Council.

    "summary": "The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020. Much of the relationship following the withdrawal is set out in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), which came fully into force in May 2021. The depth and complexity of relations between the EU and the UK following the withdrawal vary depending on the policy area concerned. For example, the TCA devotes many more articles to energy relations than to climate relations. There are a variety of reasons for this, but it can often be partially explained by the depth of previous relationships, as well as physical infrastructure already in place (such as electricity and gas interconnectors between the UK and EU Member States). In the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the UK and the EU have increased their coordination, especially on energy. At the same time, both the EU and UK are moving ahead on energy and climate issues at different paces. There are concerns, therefore, that differing regulatory approaches will result in discrepancies that could hamper trade between the EU and the UK. The focus here is on Ireland and Northern Ireland, where the absence of harmonisation could result in WTO disputes and create political tensions.",

    "summary": "Semiconductors (or chips) are the foundation of the digital transition. Their production relies on complex and vulnerable global supply chains. Against the backdrop of global chip shortages, a global 'subsidy race' in the world's main producing regions, and the renewed EU industrial policy, the Commission presented a proposal for an EU chips act aimed at reinforcing the whole EU chips value chain in February 2022. The proposal for a chips act was based on a three-pillar structure, which has been retained by the co-legislators: pillar 1 to bolster large-scale technological capacity building and innovation in the EU chips ecosystem; pillar 2 to improve the EU's security of supply; and pillar 3 to set up a monitoring and crisis response mechanism. In the event of supply crises, the Commission would be allowed to implement three types of emergency measure: asking companies for information, asking companies to accept and prioritise orders of crisis-relevant products, and making shared purchases on behalf of Member States. Following provisional political agreement reached between the co-legislators on 18 April 2023, 14 months after the publication of the Commission proposal, and after four trilogues, the Parliament is expected to adopt its position at first reading during its July 2023 plenary session.

    "summary": "China\u2019s footprint in European critical assets has grown steadily over time, without any centralised mechanism that could give the European Union (EU) and Member State agencies visibility and scrutiny over projects of strategic significance for Europe\u2019s defence and security. China\u2019s footprint poses specific challenges to Europe\u2019s efforts to protect its critical infrastructure. China\u2019s party-led political system does not allow clear distinctions between commercial, political and military interests, often viewing Chinese state and private companies\u2019 international activities as instruments helping the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) expand its influence in foreign countries and undermine geopolitical rivals. The CCP\u2019s military-civil fusion (MCF) strategy incentivises civilian actors to contribute to the modernisation of the People Liberation Army (PLA) through technology transfer. Chinese companies\u2019 access to EU critical infrastructure thus calls for an analysis of threats to Europe\u2019s defence and security architecture. Using research with original Chinese-language sources, this paper analyses the involvement of China state-linked entities in selected critical sectors \u2014 ports, rare metals and undersea cables \u2014 to identify short-, medium- and long-term threats to the EU\u2019s strategic sovereignty. These cases expose how entities linked to the Chinese party-state can gain access to and exert influence on assets that are vital to Europe\u2019s security and defence, including transport infrastructure, critical resources and telecommunications networks. This research demonstrates that traditional approaches to infrastructure protection based on direct ownership are insufficient, since China\u2019s party-state can obtain access to critical infrastructure through indirect, equally effective channels. As these cases show, infrastructure protection mechanisms, whose codification and implementation remains incomplete, must be extended to be able to scrutinise the risks that China\u2019s leverage over non-science investors and Chinese state-linked contractors pose to the EU\u2019s critical infrastructure.",

    "summary": "Equal pay for equal work is one of the European Union's founding principles, enshrined in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). However, the implementation and enforcement of this principle remain a challenge. Owing to a lack of pay transparency, pay discrimination often goes undetected, and victims face difficulties in making claims for redress. On 4 March 2021, the European Commission adopted a legislative proposal on binding pay transparency measures. The proposed directive to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work, or work of equal value between men and women through pay transparency and enforcement mechanisms, focuses on measures to ensure pay transparency and better access to justice for victims of pay discrimination. The Council agreed its approach on the proposal on 6 December 2021. On 5 April 2022, Parliament voted to confirm the joint committee's negotiating mandate on the proposal with a view to initiating informal trilogue negotiations with the Council. Interinstitutional negotiations started on 30 June. On 15 December 2022, after five trilogue meetings, an agreement on the proposal was reached. The Parliament adopted the text in plenary on 30 March 2023, and on 24 April, the Council also did so.

    "summary": "On 26 April 2023, the European Commission launched a revision of the EU's pharmaceutical legislation, including legislation on medicines for children and for rare diseases. Since the early 2000s, the EU legislative framework has provided a complex set of obligations, incentives and rewards to stimulate the development of medicines for children and for rare disease patients. Over the last 20 years, the EU legislation has led to the development of new medicines for these categories of patients. The legislation has not been flexible enough, however, to integrate scientific and technological advances, nor has it been able to direct research and development towards areas of unmet medical needs. Given the key role of Member States in determining the availability and affordability of medicines, implementation of the legislation cannot be assessed in isolation from the national context. This concerns, notably, key aspects such as pricing and reimbursement of medicines, taxation, and healthcare organisation, but also strategic decisions by pharmaceutical companies.",

    "summary": "The question of whether the 34 decentralised European Union (EU) Agencies and EPPO are adequately equipped with human and financial resources is a recurring discussion in the different budget and discharge procedures addressing the work of the Agencies. A common issue voiced is that extensions of an agency\u2019s mandate are not matched by a corresponding increase in available funding and human resources. In a special report on the future of EU agencies from 2020, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) comes to a similar conclusion, stating that new tasks for the agencies rarely come with an adequate number of additional posts in the establishment plan.   Further issues relevant in the context of EU agencies and their management are the increasingly important role of Contract Agents (CAs) as part of the Agencies\u2019 structural workforce, problems with finding suitable staff in certain policy areas and in Member States with lower remuneration due to lower correction coefficients  and the use of interim staff and \u201crevolving doors\u201d. By providing and discussing a variety of available statistics and data as regards the financial and human resources of decentralised agencies, this briefing aims to give a comprehensive overview regarding this issue. First, this briefing shows broader trends of staff developments in the EU decentralised Agencies. Then, it considers other issues related to personnel and staffing, before finally focusing on budgetary trends.",

In recent years, however, there have been increasingly worrying trends across the European Union (EU), as documented in the annual rule of law reports by the European Commission and other tools such as the Media Pluralism Monitor. Published on 16 September 2022, the European media freedom act (EMFA) proposes a new set of rules to promote media pluralism and independence across the EU, and would amend the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. The aim is to prevent political interference in editorial decisions and ensure transparency of media ownership. The proposed act seeks to protect journalists from having to disclose their sources and from the use of spyware against them. It also sets requirements for audience measurement systems and transparent allocation of state advertising. Media content would be better protected against online content removal, and a new European board for media services would be established. In the Parliament, the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) is the committee responsible, with the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) as associated committees.

    "title": "Cohesion partnership agreements: Implementation and oversight",
    "summary": "Partnership agreements (PAs) are overarching documents that define the strategy and investment priorities for the cohesion policy funds. By the end of 2022, the PAs for all 27 Member States for the 2021-2027 programming period had been adopted; EU support is worth \u20ac368 billion and the total investment is \u20ac545 billion, taking into account national financing. PAs in this programming period are much shorter and more concise documents than the agreements in the 2014-2020 period. The two policy objectives (POs) with the largest allocations are PO4 Social Europe and PO2 Greener Europe. Most of the funding is earmarked for the less developed regions, where gross domestic product (GDP) per inhabitant was less than 75 % of the EU average in the 2015-2017 period. With the programming completed, the implementation phase is now in full swing as the regions start spending the funds in accordance with the measures and priorities outlined in the PAs. However, ensuring fulfilment of all outstanding horizontal and thematic enabling conditions is key for the effective delivery of results. In general, PAs and their oversight are a responsibility of the European Commission, which has the lead among the EU institutions in implementing cohesion policy. The Commission assesses the PAs' compliance with the Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) \u2013 including the horizontal principles, such as partnership and subsidiarity \u2013 and approves them via implementing acts. The European Parliament can exercise its role of political scrutiny and oversight of the Commission. As co-legislator for the CPR, Parliament has the right to be informed about the implementation of the Regulation, and can submit parliamentary questions asking the Commission to explain how it verifies that the horizontal principles are respected in the PAs. Through the discharge procedure, Parliament can ensure ex-post democratic oversight at political level of how the EU's budget has been used. However, Parliament cannot veto PAs as such, as it has no formal role in the approval procedure. Nevertheless, gradual steps could be taken to increase transparency and oversight. For example, Parliament could insist on the public release of the Commission's assessments of the PAs, similarly to the assessments of the national recovery and resilience plans.",

    "title": "Recreational use of cannabis: Laws and policies in selected EU Member States",
    "summary": "Cannabis is by far the most commonly used illicit drug (referred to as drug in this briefing) in the European Union (EU), where its distribution, cultivation, possession and use (consumption) are largely prohibited. The prohibition of drug-related activities other than those performed for medical or scientific purposes is the defining feature of the international drug control system. Set up by the United Nations (UN), this system is composed of three complementary conventions, to which all EU Member States are parties. Various countries around the world have made use of the flexibility of the UN system, not applying criminal penalties in some cases (e.g. for possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use) or replacing them with administrative ones. The UN bodies monitoring compliance with the conventions seem to have come to accept these policy choices. However, they remain resistant to the still rare yet increasingly common practice of legalising the recreational use of cannabis, which may entail regulating drug distribution and sale in a manner akin to that for alcohol and tobacco. In the EU, drug policy has remained primarily the Member States' preserve. The EU has fostered the Member States' cooperation on law enforcement and health-related issues, while at the same time respecting their diverse philosophies on how to address recreational drug use. National approaches range from very restrictive policies that prioritise criminal law responses, to more liberal ones that focus primarily on reducing the health and social harms resulting from drug use. In 2021, Malta became the first Member State to legalise recreational cannabis, and since then several others have taken steps that could potentially lead to similar drug policy reforms. The following EPRS policy analysts contributed to the country analyses in this briefing: Antonio Albaladejo Roman (Spain), David De Groot (Germany), Micaela Del Monte (Luxembourg), Verena Kern (Austria), Silvia Kotanidis (Italy), Marie Lecerf (France), Gabija Leclerc (Lithuania), Katrien Luyten (Belgium), Ingeborg Odink (the Netherlands), Anita Orav (Estonia), Marketa Pape (Czechia), Martina Prpic (Croatia) and Rosamund Shreeves (Malta).",

    "summary": "Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and United States-China rivalry continue to dominate the global political and economic landscape in 2023. Challenges to the multilateral rules-based global order are redefining strategic relations. In its attempt to foster alliances, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President (HR/VP) and the European Commission adopted a joint communication setting out a new agenda for relations between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) on 7 June 2023. To strengthen and modernise the strategic partnership, reinforced political engagement, boosted trade and investment, and more sustainable investment through the Global Gateway connectivity strategy are key priorities of the EU strategy towards the region \u2013 one of the most aligned in terms of interests, culture and values. Less than a year earlier, on 27 October 2022, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) and EU foreign ministers adopted the joint CELAC-EU Roadmap 2022 2023 in Buenos Aires. This paved the way for the long-awaited EU-CELAC Summit to take place in Brussels, set for 17 18 July 2023, under the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU. Expectations are high, as this will be the first fully-fledged summit in 8 years. EU-CELAC relations are not free of challenges: the LAC countries' stance on Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine (including EU sanctions against Russia), China's emergence as a key actor in Latin America, political and ideological divisions and economic asymmetries within the LAC region, and concerns relating to EU legislation on the green transition all need to be addressed. A litmus test for the strategic partnership will also be whether the partners manage to finalise the three key pending international agreements (Mercosur, Mexico and Chile).",

From the very outset, in 2021, implementation of the EU's 2021-2027 budget faced challenging circumstances, with the pandemic and its consequences. In response, the EU and its Member States mobilised \u20ac3.7 trillion overall, with the EU budget providing direct support of \u20ac70 billion to help EU citizens and enterprises, and countries outside the EU, cope with the COVID-19 crisis. Financial pressure amplified in 2022 with Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. The EU and its Member States have so far provided \u20ac72 billion in financial, military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. The war has, in addition, led to inflationary pressure, diminishing the real-terms value of financial resources. The EU's budgetary resources for the current financial period from 2021 to 2027 were originally set at \u20ac1.8 trillion from the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and from the EU's temporary recovery instrument, Next Generation EU (NGEU). These resources have been consumed much faster than anticipated. The funds set aside for responding to unforeseeable events, the special instruments, earmarked \u20ac10.5 billion for the years 2021 to 2024 and are almost entirely depleted. The European Parliament has called repeatedly for a meaningful and urgent revision of the EU budget. This briefing presents the state of the EU's finances as initially set for 2021 to 2027, as updated in June 2023, and provides an overview of how the EU's financial means have been impacted by two major unexpected crises. It provides background information in view of the Commission's adoption of the MFF revision, scheduled for 20 June 2023.",

    "summary": "Most of the Member States have used corporate sponsorship during their Council presidency. Although the official meetings of the Council are financed by the EU budget, the rotating presidency usually organises unofficial meetings and events that are not covered, while other extra costs also incur due to the presidency tasks. Even the regular Council tasks may costs extra for the Member State holding the presidency as it may need to reinforce the permanent representation in Brussels, send more diplomats to be present at all the meetings in Brussels, and also take care of more officials or politicians visiting the country than usual. A Council presidency may also be a good opportunity for the country to promote its local businesses, tourist attractions or cultural heritage. Therefore, it is customary to organise political, business, social and cultural events connected to the presidency in the home country, in Brussels or other Member States. These meetings require venues, transport, security, travel and accommodations, catering, interpretation and translation, technical support and media logistics.  All these extra costs are borne by the Member State, and many of them choose to involve sponsors in covering these. Sponsors mostly contribute in kind, most often with transport solutions, catering, IT or communications. In exchange, these sponsors may be presented with their names and logos alongside official Council Presidency logos.",

In December 2021, after evaluating progress in TEN-T implementation, the European Commission put forward a proposal on the revised TEN T guidelines to ensure sustainable connectivity through a reliable and high-quality infrastructure network aligned with the objectives of the European Green Deal. In May 2022, the Commission published an amended version of this proposal, extending transport corridors to Ukraine and Moldova and withdrawing plans that included Russia and Belarus. The European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted its report on the proposal on 13 April 2023; the Council adopted its general approach on 5 December 2022.

Following this vote, Parliament will start negotiations with the national governments and the European Commission on the final shape of the legislation, which will be a decisive step in the European Union becoming the world\u2019s first region to regulate artificial intelligence (AI). The recent launches of AI tools capable of generating direct textual answers to questions, notably ChatGPT, and the development of general-purpose AI technologies are expected to revolutionise the application of AI in society. The US and China are also working on AI regulation. In addition, the US and EU hope to negotiate a voluntary code of conduct for AI firms. The Artificial Intelligence Act would regulate AI according to the level of risk: the higher the risk to individuals' fundamental rights or safety, the greater the system's obligations. The EU's proposed high-risk list includes AI in critical infrastructure, education, human resources, public order and migration management.

The fit for 55 package includes a regulation establishing a new social climate fund (SCF). The aim of the SCF is to help vulnerable households, micro-businesses and transport users counter the additional costs they may face when the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) Directive is revised to cover these two sectors. The SCF should provide up to \u20ac65 billion in EU funding over the 2026-2032 period, mainly through ETS credits in the buildings and road transport sectors. Member States are expected to co-finance 25% of the total estimated cost of their social plans.

    "title": "Understanding EU action against human trafficking",
    "summary": "In December 2022, the European Commission presented a proposal to review Directive 2011/36/EU to strengthen the rules on combating trafficking in human beings and to better protect victims. Despite some progress achieved in recent years, it is estimated that over 7 000 people become victims of human trafficking in the EU on an annual basis, although the figure could be much higher because many victims remain undetected. Human trafficking is not only a serious and borderless crime, but also a lucrative business, driven by demand for sexual (and other) services. Criminals exploit vulnerable people (increasingly children), making high profits and taking relatively low risks. Vulnerability can result from a whole range of factors, including socio-economic ones, and migrants are a particularly vulnerable group. Gender also plays an important part, as women and men are not trafficked in the same way or for the same purpose. Women and girls represent a disproportionately high number of victims, both globally and at EU level, especially in terms of sexual exploitation. This form of exploitation is still dominant in the EU, even though other forms are on the rise, such as exploitation for forced labour and for criminal activities. The COVID 19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have brought new challenges for victims, as well as amplifying the vulnerabilities of those most at risk. Traffickers \u2013 like legal businesses \u2013 have increasingly moved to digital modi operandi. In its efforts to eradicate human trafficking, the EU has not only created a legal framework, comprising an anti-trafficking directive and instruments to protect victims' rights and prevent labour exploitation; it has also put in place an operational cooperation network involving decentralised EU agencies, including Europol, Eurojust, CEPOL and Frontex. Moreover, trafficking in human beings is a priority in the EU policy cycle for organised and serious international crime. The European Parliament plays a major role, not only in designing policies but also in evaluating their implementation. This is an update of a briefing written by Piotr B\u0105kowski and Sofija Voronova in 2021.",

The proposed gigabit infrastructure act, introducing a regulation that would review and replace the existing Broadband Cost Reduction Directive, aims at facilitating and stimulating the provision of very high-capacity networks by promoting the joint use of existing physical infrastructure and by enabling a more efficient deployment of new physical infrastructure, so that such networks can be rolled out faster and at lower cost.

    "summary": "Next Generation EU (NGEU) is the unprecedented instrument created by the European Union (EU) to help Member States recover from the socio-economic impact of the COVID 19 crisis, while also addressing structural challenges such as the green and digital transition. Its main spending tool is the \u20ac723.8 billion Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) that finances ambitious packages of reform and investment measures agreed in the Member States' national recovery and resilience plans (NRRPs). Given the RRF's strong links with the European Semester, the EU's economic governance coordination framework regularly takes stock of progress in RRF implementation. Combined with additional data on payments received so far by Member States (30.6 % of the approved allocation on average) and the milestones and targets linked to those payments (11 % of the overall objectives under the plans), the documents in the 2023 European Semester spring package provide an overview of the state of play in the implementation of the RRF in individual Member States. According to the European Commission, the deployment of the RRF is broadly on track. Variations appear to be emerging across the EU, however, since on the basis of the country-specific recommendations and reports, Member States can be classified into four broad groups as regards implementation of their NRRPs: 1) well under way (in 9 Member States); 2) under way (14); 3) under way with significant delays (2); and 4) significantly delayed (2). With 89 % of the milestones and targets still to be achieved, the years to 2026, the final year for the RRF, will be crucial for successful completion of the plans. Their ongoing revision, not least for the inclusion of new REPowerEU chapters on reinforced energy measures, may trigger delays in 2023, but it is also an opportunity to address current challenges, such as unexpectedly high inflation. As of 12 June 2023, only a quarter of Member States had submitted their REPowerEU chapters, which must be agreed and operational by the end of 2023 at the latest.",

Despite progress achieved in fighting this crime, the Commission reports that, on average, 7 000 people per year are victims of human trafficking in the EU and that this figure is most likely only the tip of the iceberg. Moreover, forms of exploitation have evolved over time and have adapted to the new environment. For instance, criminal networks are now taking advantage of the possibilities offered by new technologies to recruit victims. Most recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has generated a massive displacement of women and children and created new opportunities for criminal organisations. While a large majority of victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation are women and girls, men are more victims of trafficking for labour exploitation, the share of which is increasing, or are forced to commit criminal activities. Against this background, the Commission is proposing a set of amendments to strengthen the current rules, further harmonise provisions across Member States in order to reduce demand, and collect robust data and statistics.",

    "summary": "In December 2022, the Commission presented two proposals to revise the rules on the collection and transfer of advance passenger information (API) data \u2013 data collected by air carriers at check-in and sent to competent authorities in the country of destination prior to the flight's take-off. One of the proposals is for a new regulation on the collection and transfer of API data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal seeks to align the rules on the collection and transfer of API data with the rules on the processing of passenger name records (PNR) \u2013 data from air travellers' ticket reservations \u2013 in order to increase the effectiveness of the fight against serious crimes and terrorism in the EU. The proposal provides uniform criteria for the collection and transfer of API data on extra-EU flights and selected intra-EU flights. It builds on the provisions of another proposal for a regulation on the collection and transfer of API data for enhancing and facilitating external border controls. Both proposals rely on the establishment of a centralised router to enable the transmission of API data between air carriers and the competent national authorities dealing with API data. The proposal falls under the ordinary legislative procedure. In the European Parliament, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has appointed a rapporteur, Assita Kanko (ECR, Belgium), who has begun preparing a draft report.

    "title": "Proposal for a simplification of VAT rules for e-commerce (imports)",
    "summary": "The rise of e-commerce has required the system of value-added tax (VAT) to adapt and ensure that the rules allow for a smooth and fraud-proof transaction between customer and seller. The major overhaul of the VAT rules for e-commerce in 2021 introduced a series of important simplifications for businesses, such as the creation of an import one-stop shop (IOSS). The IOSS allows businesses to declare and remit VAT on all their business-to-consumer (B2C) distance sales of imported goods across the EU (i.e. goods bought online by a customer established in the EU with the goods dispatched from a third country) through one single VAT return, rather than in each country where they make a sale. However, at the moment, the IOSS operates with a threshold, whereby the distance selling of goods with a value above \u20ac150 cannot be declared in the IOSS. Having assessed that the \u20ac150 threshold constitutes a burden to businesses, the Commission proposed on 17 May 2023 to further expand the IOSS by removing the threshold entirely. This change would open the use of the IOSS to a wider range of businesses, which would benefit from lower compliance costs. The proposal is subject to a special legislative procedure, requiring unanimous support in the Council, following consultation of the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee.

    "summary": "In December 2022, the Commission presented two proposals to revise the rules on the collection and transfer of advance passenger information (API) data \u2013 data collected by air carriers at check-in and sent to border control authorities in the country of destination prior to a flight's take-off. The current directive on the collection and transfer of API data will be replaced by two regulations: one on the collection and transfer of API data for border management purposes, and another on the collection and transfer of API data for law enforcement purposes. The proposal on the collection and transfer of API data for border management seeks to enhance and facilitate the effectiveness and efficiency of border checks at external borders and to combat irregular immigration. It provides a revised and extended list of API data and makes mandatory the collection of API data on all scheduled and non-scheduled flights into the EU. It also establishes a new technical solution (a router) to enable air carriers to transfer API data to the competent national authorities though a single, centralised system, under strict data protection and security rules. The proposal falls under the ordinary legislative proposal where the European Parliament and the Council act as co-legislators.

    "title": "EU carbon border adjustment mechanism: Implications for climate and competitiveness",
    "summary": "The EU has the world's largest carbon-pricing system, the emissions trading system (ETS). Emissions pricing can encourage industrial decarbonisation, but it also risks carbon leakage, whereby EU companies move their production abroad. To date, the EU has mitigated this risk through free allocations to certain industries, but with rising climate ambition and higher carbon prices, the Commission is now seeking to phase out free allocations. A new carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) will also be introduced, requiring EU importers, as of 2026, to purchase certificates equivalent to the weekly EU carbon price. The CBAM initially applies to imports in five emissions-intensive sectors deemed at greater risk of carbon leakage: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, and electricity. The CBAM charge covers imports of these goods from all third countries other than those included in the ETS or a linked mechanism. The CBAM aims to contribute to the EU's climate neutrality objectives, and encourage partner countries to decarbonise their production processes by levelling the playing field in carbon pricing between the EU and third-country producers. Parliament referred the file to the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). The Council adopted its general approach on 15 March and Parliament adopted its negotiating position on 22 June 2022. A provisional trilogue agreement was reached on 13 December, and confirmed by both co-legislators.

    "summary": "France's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) is a subpart of 'France Relance', a larger recovery strategy adopted by France at national level, worth \u20ac100 billion in total (4.1 % of France's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019). The implementation of France's NRRP includes EU support worth \u20ac39.4 billion in grants under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF). France has decided to use its entire national allocation for grants and not to request loans. The resources allocated to France represent 5.4 % of the entire RRF resources for the EU, and 1.6 % of the country's GDP in 2019 (the RRF representing 5.2 % of EU-27 GDP in 2019). Measures under the plan are to be completed by 2026. So far, following the Council's approval of its RRP in July 2021, France has received \u20ac12.5 billion (31.7 % of the resources) in the form of pre-financing (August 2021) and a first instalment (March 2022). The next payments, in four yearly instalments, will depend on progress in implementing the plan. In June 2022, the maximum grant allocation available for France was revised downwards to \u20ac37.5 billion (- 4.8 %). On 20 April 2023, France sent to the Commission a request to amend its NRRP, and to add a new dedicated REPowerEU chapter on energy measures for which additional grant resources worth \u20ac2.8 billion are available. The European Parliament, which was a major advocate for the creation of a common EU recovery instrument, participates in interinstitutional forums for cooperation and discussion on its implementation and scrutinises the work of the European Commission.

    "summary": "Emerging alongside the rapid development of the internet and digital technologies that have particularly thrived over the past two decades, music streaming (and streaming in general) is a technology that offers unlimited access to a selected catalogue of audiovisual content via an online platform. The year 2006 is often seen as the starting date for music streaming, with the launch of the Swedish streaming platform Spotify, the current market leader. The technology, however, had already been developed long before and in reality does not result from \u2018one innovation but a collection of many\u2019 (Fagerjord, 2019). Since its origins, the legal streaming market has been transformed profoundly, especially in terms of its economics, generating satisfaction, concerns and criticism (Hesmondhalgh, 2022). Indeed, the overall \u2018systemic changes\u2019 from which streaming derives and to which it responds are not yet fully understood and have not been addressed beyond the common individual user-centred approach (Camilleri et al., 2020; Jansson, 2021). This is particularly important as streaming currently represents the bulk of music sales and is the second largest source of revenue for the music industry (Legrand Network, 2022; Lozic et al., 2022).",

    "summary": "The European Union has found new impetus for enlargement in the wake of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, making progress in what was once called the EU\u2019s most successful policy. A year ago, the EU granted Ukraine and Moldova official EU candidate status and also opened the same possibility for Georgia. Politicians and analysts more and more often say that the EU should become more involved in the Western Balkan countries, which saw their membership prospects open 20 years ago. If it does not, those countries could drift away politically from the Union and exacerbate conflicts in the post-Yugoslav area. For Turkey, EU membership is no longer a priority, while popular support for EU accession is declining in Serbia, partly due to the influence of Russia. \u2018There is a new awareness inside the EU. We finally realise that it is not enough to just wait for our friends outside the Union to move closer to us. It is not enough to say that the door is open. We must also take responsibility to bring the aspiring members of our Union much closer to us,\u2019 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the GLOBSEC conference in Bratislava in May.

    "summary": "Online child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) and grooming (manipulative practices aimed at exploiting and abusing people), now increasingly targeting younger children, have been spreading at an alarming rate. In 2022, the more than 32 million reports of suspected online child sexual abuse, represented a historical peak. Among these reports, those on grooming marked an 82 % increase. Most of the activities detected were hosted in Europe. In response to this situation, on 11 May 2022 the European Commission adopted a proposal for long-term rules to prevent and combat child abuse. The Commission proposal would require interpersonal communication services, such as webmail messaging services and internet telephony, as well as others, to proactively detect online CSAM materials and activities involving child grooming. However, this poses many concerns regarding privacy, security and law enforcement investigations. The proposal also provides for the establishment of an EU centre to support the implementation and supervision of the new rules. In the Parliament, the file has been assigned to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). The draft report was submitted on 19 April 2023.

    "summary": "With the intention of informing discussion in the approach to the 2024 European elections, this study examines the historical, factual and legal aspects surrounding the Spitzenkandidaten, or lead candidate process, which establishes a political link between the nomination of the President of the European Commission and the political composition of the European Parliament. This study retraces the evolution of Parliament's role in the investiture of the President of the Commission, explains the reasons why such an innovation was deemed necessary as early as the early 1990s and assesses the results of this innovative process in the last two elections. The lead candidate process achieved its purposes with the election of Jean Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission in 2014, while this was not the case in 2019, Ursula von der Leyen not having been a candidate. There is therefore some uncertainty over the future of the lead candidate process and whether there is appetite for a repetition in 2024. This paper takes stock of the reasons for the failure in 2019 and assesses the aspects that performed well, and those that did not, in the past. The analysis concludes with proposals for the future, with a view to healing the fractures that emerged during the last appointment process, seeking to explore how the lead candidate process may become part of the European Union's institutional set-up.",

Overall, it provides a complete and detailed explanation of the problem, of its scope, drivers, and of the need to take EU-level action. It is well-substantiated and relies on the evaluation of the directive conducted in parallel with the IA, stakeholder feedback, comprehensive desk research and recent data from Eurostat. The IA is also transparent on the limits of the data it uses, which is coherent with the specific objective of the proposal to improve detection and monitoring of trafficking in human beings. The IA considers security, social, economic and fundamental rights impacts, but does not discuss relations or cooperation with third countries, which could be relevant due to trafficking's cross-border nature. The construction of policy options appears to offer a very limited range of genuine alternatives, mainly sub-options that are not systematically compared. Finally, the quantitative cost-benefit analysis would have benefited from inclusion of an assessment of the policy options' impact on the number of law-enforcement procedures, and on the number of offences prevented.",

    "summary": "The EU institutions engage in regular structured dialogue with representatives of churches, and religious, non-confessional and philosophical organisations, on the basis of Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This dialogue, which takes the form of high-level meetings or working-level discussions, is focused on policy issues on the European agenda. It traces its origins to earlier initiatives, such as that launched in 1994 by Jacques Delors \u2013 'A soul for Europe' \u2013 which aimed to find ways to build an ethical, moral and spiritual dimension into European integration and policy-shaping. The draft Constitutional Treaty of 2004 included provisions on regular, open and transparent dialogue between EU institutions, and representatives of churches and religious communities, and of non-confessional or philosophical communities. Although the Constitutional Treaty was rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands, its successor, the Lisbon Treaty, adopted in 2007 and in force since December 2009, preserved the same provisions in its Article 17 TFEU. The European Parliament has long stressed the importance of constant dialogue among, and with, religious and non-confessional and philosophical communities. Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it sought to give substance to the provisions of Article 17 TFEU, primarily by organising dialogue on subjects of interest for the EU and its citizens. The European Commission and the Council are also bound by Article 17 TFEU provisions. This is a further updated version of a briefing first published in 2018. The previous edition was issued in April 2022.",

    "summary": "Export credits are a traditional instrument used in many member states of the European Union to support the export activities of firms. They are typically provided by export credit agencies (ECAs), which in turn receive support from governments. There are currently 25 such ECAs in 21 EU member states. Financial and indirect support to exporters provided through these ECAs is significant. Recent policy initiatives of the European Commission, such as the European Green Deal and Global Gateway, raise the question of how aligned these transactions and their underlying due diligence practices are vis-\u00e0-vis high-ranking policy goals such as the green transition. The objective of the present study is to explore and compare EU trade policy in the field of export credits with a view to their alignment with these policy goals. Drawing on information from ECA annual activity reports in conjunction with expert interviews, this study identifies ongoing commitments, practices and standards and discusses the extent to which ECAs are in line with EU policy commitments. The paper outlines a set of recommendations on how ECA coherence with EU goals could be strengthened in the future, proposing, among other things, that the EU push for more systemic forms of climate risk assessment and more ambitious public disclosure practices among ECAs.",

Home to 345 million people when it was launched in 1993, it now numbers 447 million consumers and 23 million companies, and covers a considerable range of policy areas. This year, the single market is celebrating its 30th anniversary. While the single market generates many jobs and considerable economic benefits, many hurdles remain. In March 2020, the Commission identified the top 13 barriers to cross-border activity (such as red tape), and the five main root causes of these barriers (such as inadequate enforcement of legislation). Furthermore, recent shocks \u2013 including the pandemic and Russia's war on Ukraine \u2013 resulting in restrictions to free movement, shortages of goods and services, and rising energy prices, have shown not only how vulnerable the single market can be to crises, but also the extent to which the EU economy relies on a well-functioning single market. In May 2022, the plenary of the Conference on the Future of Europe proposed to deepen the single market further. On 18 January 2023, Parliament adopted a resolution on the 30th anniversary of the single market. Reaffirming its readiness to play its role in the process, Parliament called for renewed commitment from the Member States and the other EU institutions, and a specific agenda for action towards 2030 and beyond, to strengthen and develop the single market further, not least in areas such as services, energy, telecommunications and the digital single market. On 16 March 2023, the Commission put forward a communication on the single market at 30, in which it discusses a possible way towards further single market integration.

    "summary": "Given the important role they play in the roll-out of zero-emission mobility and the storage of intermittent renewable energy, batteries are a crucial element in the EU's transition to a climate neutral economy. On 10 December 2020, the European Commission presented a proposal designed to modernise the EU's regulatory framework for batteries in order to secure the sustainability and competitiveness of battery value chains. The proposal seeks to introduce mandatory requirements on sustainability (such as carbon footprint rules, minimum recycled content, performance and durability criteria), safety and labelling for the marketing and putting into service of batteries, and requirements for end-of-life management. It also includes due diligence obligations for economic operators as regards the sourcing of raw materials. The European Parliament and the Council reached a provisional agreement on the file on 9 December 2022. The text agreed in trilogue negotiations amends the original Commission proposal substantially, notably by including batteries for light means of transport, such as e-bikes and e-scooters, within the regulation's scope, and by strengthening due diligence requirements. It awaits formal adoption by Parliament, with a plenary vote scheduled during the June 2023 session. Fourth edition.

    "title": "Political parties, voter mobilisation and the 1979 European elections",
    "summary": "As part of its 'New Push for European Democracy', the European Commission has proposed a revision of Regulation No 1141/2014 on the statute and funding of the European political parties and European political foundations. The European Parliament (EP) is currently discussing the Commission proposal, with the Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) Committee having appointed Rainer Wieland (EPP, Germany) and Charles Goerens (Renew, Luxembourg) as co-rapporteurs. This activity surrounding the governance of European political parties (or 'Europarties') reveals a widely held belief that they play a crucial role in transnational democracy in the European Union (EU), in particular as intermediaries between the EP and the European citizen. Indeed, Article 10(4) of the Treaty on European Union explicitly states that they 'contribute to forming European political awareness and to expressing the will of citizens of the Union'. However, in the years preceding the first EP elections in 1979, while the concern to connect with and mobilise citizens was widespread, there was less agreement on the need for European parties. As this briefing shows, though it was universally accepted that political parties were necessary to prepare the public for the first European elections, the idea that self-standing European parties were a pre-requisite for successful European elections eventually gave way to the notion of European parties as a coordinating structure for national parties\u2019 autonomous campaigns. Strikingly, this debate over the nature of European parties and their relationship to European elections continues to this day, highlighting its importance for European integration. This briefing traces the debates in the European Parliament on the role of political parties in preparing the European electorate for the first direct European elections in 1979, starting from the preparation of the 1960 Draft Convention on European elections. The briefing concludes with a short discussion of the evolution of Europarties and EP elections after 1979, in the light of the pre-1979 debates.",

    "title": "Electoral thresholds  in European Parliament elections",
    "summary": "An electoral threshold for the allocation of seats is the minimum percentage of votes that a political party or a coalition is required to collect in order to gain a seat in the legislative assembly. Thresholds are said to enable a better balance between governability and representativeness, by favouring the formation of stable majorities and avoiding excessive fragmentation of the legislative assembly. Thresholds are sometimes imposed by law, but in the absence of an explicit legal requirement, they can be the de facto result of the size of the constituency and the relevant electoral law determining the apportionment of seats between constituencies. Provisions for electoral thresholds are common in proportional electoral systems, which tend to favour multipartyism. Thresholds can, however, be problematic when they limit or impede the representation of regional parties and ethnic and linguistic minorities, for instance. The current European Electoral Act contains a set of common principles to be upheld by the different domestic laws applicable to the election of the European Parliament. The original act of 1976 did not contain any provisions on minimum thresholds. Following modifications introduced in 2002, Article 3 allows Member States to set a minimum threshold for the allocation of seats; this must not exceed 5 % of the votes cast. More recently, a draft legislative act, adopted by the European Parliament in May 2022 and seeking to repeal the 1976 Act, proposes to modify Article 3. Member States would remain free to establish an electoral threshold of no more than 5 % of the valid votes cast, but they would be obliged to establish a threshold \u2013 of no less than 3.5 % and no more than 5 % \u2013 for national constituencies comprising more than 60 seats. The electoral thresholds applied in the 2019 European elections ranged between 5 % of the valid votes cast, required in nine Member States (Czechia, France, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) and 1.8 %, required in Cyprus, while 14 Member States set no threshold. Italy, Austria and Sweden applied a 4 % threshold; and Greece 3 %. At the time of writing, it appears that these thresholds will still be applicable for the 2024 European elections.",

    "summary": "On 1 June 2023, Moldova hosted the second meeting of the European Political Community (EPC) in Bulboaca, just a few kilometres from the Ukrainian border. The focus of this informal forum of 48 leaders from across the European continent was clearly more on peace and security \u2013 with all participants reiterating their unity in support of Ukraine \u2013 and less on energy and interconnectivity, the other topic on the agenda. Discussions took place in plenary and roundtable format, showing continuity in method with the inaugural EPC meeting held in Prague in 2022. Enlargement, although not officially a topic for discussion, was placed at the centre of the debates by the President of Moldova, Maia Sandu, and the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who this time attended the summit in person. The two leaders pleaded for the opening of EU accession negotiations by the end of this year. In addition, Zelenskyy advocated powerfully for a strong signal from NATO at the upcoming summit of the Alliance in Vilnius on 11 July 2023, both regarding Ukraine's accession and concerning security guarantees on the way to membership. This to some extent transformed the meeting into an informal preparatory meeting for the NATO and European Council meetings later this year, touching on and possibly easing potential sensitivities. No summit declaration was adopted, confirming the EPC's informal platform format. A series of side meetings allowed leaders to discuss issues of direct interest to their own countries. Side meetings were also used for mediation purposes in the case of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, and to attempt to put the Pristina-Belgrade dialogue back on track, after the recent spike in violence.",

    "summary": "As the civil war in Syria enters its 13th year, and amidst ongoing political instability and armed clashes, the humanitarian and economic situation in the country continues to deteriorate. Half of the country's 22.1 million population is internally or externally displaced and 15.3 million people \u2013 nearly 70 % of Syrians \u2013 are in need of humanitarian assistance. Following the deadly earthquake in early February 2023, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated further. Since the beginning of the conflict there in 2011, Syria has been under one of the most extensive sets of sanctions in the world. Since the early days of the conflict, the European Union (EU) imposed sanctions on members and supporters of the regime of Bashar al-Assad as well as sectors of the economy benefiting the regime; since then, the scope of the measures has been expanded further. EU sanctions are designed to have minimal impact on the civilian population, and contain exceptions (exemptions and derogations) to the prohibitions, to avoid impeding the delivery of humanitarian assistance to and inside the country. Nevertheless, humanitarian operators report that unintended 'side-effects' of the sanctions have complicated their activities. To mitigate this, the EU has been engaging with all stakeholders to find solutions. The EU has been at the forefront of providing humanitarian, development, economic and stabilisation assistance, channelled through humanitarian operators to the Syrian population. Together with its Member States, the EU is the biggest donor to the Syrian people. However, in line with its strategy on Syria, the EU does not provide reconstruction assistance to the Syrian regime, pending implementation of concrete steps outlined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015). The European Parliament has been vocal in expressing its concerns over the deteriorating human rights and humanitarian situation in Syria, condemning the violence and attacks, including on humanitarian aid workers, mostly by the Syrian regime, but also by other parties. Parliament supports the EU's approach to sanctions, and advocates the scaling-up of humanitarian assistance.",

Unlike similar EU measures, most of its climate support is done via tax subsidies. Although hailed in the EU for heralding a new era in US climate policy, the IRA is being criticised for its outright 'Buy American' provisions. Amongst others, it is feared that EU exports to the US will be hampered, and that EU firms might be enticed to relocate to the US. So far, the EU has reacted by adapting its State aid rules and the legislative proposals of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, but it also relies upon the Recovery and Resilience Facility's dedicated climate subsidies to offset the IRA's effects on the EU economy. Further possible EU responses are currently discussed.",

The fifth World Food Safety Day will be celebrated on 7 June 2023, to draw attention to the need to prevent, detect and manage foodborne risks, and to inspire action in this regard. The globalisation of the food trade, a growing world population, climate change and rapidly changing food systems all have an impact on food safety. World Health Organization (WHO) data reveal that unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances can cause more than 200 different diseases, ranging from diarrhoea to cancer. Around the world, an estimated 600 million people fall ill after eating contaminated food each year. This leads to 420 000 deaths and the loss of 33 million healthy life years (the number of years that a person is expected to continue to live in a healthy condition). To prevent foodborne diseases and empower consumers worldwide to make healthier choices, the WHO has issued a set of key recommendations on safer food, formulated by a group of international scientists. In the EU, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is tasked with providing impartial scientific advice and communicating on risks associated with the food chain. Together with national food safety agencies, EFSA has been building a growing food-safety knowledge ecosystem, ensuring that safe food remains the basis for healthy diets and sustainable food systems.",

    "summary": "The 49th G7 Summit, bringing together the leaders of the United States (US), Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union (EU), took place on 19 21 May 2023 under the Japanese Presidency in Hiroshima, a city with worldwide symbolic importance for war, nuclear devastation and peace. Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine dominated the leaders' summit once again, with Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, attending in person. The other main issue was the need to increase economic resilience and build a unified G7 approach towards China. This year's summit took place at a time where the multilateral rules-based global order is being challenged, in particular by Russia and China, and strategic relations around the world are being redefined. Key states from the Global South are becoming increasingly important for the West, in order to isolate Russia and address global challenges. For this reason, in addition to Zelenskyy, the Japanese Presidency invited a series of leaders, including those of the G20 troika \u2013 Indonesia, India and Brazil (India assumed the G20 Presidency on 1 December 2022 from Indonesia, and will hand it over to Brazil in December this year). The G7 leaders made strong commitments to global partners, in particular those in the Global South, in their various communiqu\u00e9s and statements. Some side meetings drew media attention, notably that between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The resulting leaders' communiqu\u00e9 focused on support for Ukraine, disarmament and non-proliferation, economic security, clean tech economy, food security and the convergence of policy towards China. Many commentators drew an important parallel between the reiterated strong support for Ukraine and an underlying message that the international community would provide equal support were Taiwan to be in peril. In this regard, it is also interesting to note the timing of President Biden's announcement at the G7 that the US would support a joint international effort to train Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets.",

    "summary": "Ever since the end of the Cold War, Armenia and Azerbaijan have been in conflict over Nagorno Karabakh, in the longest-running conflict in the post-Soviet space. Two bloody war episodes, in 1992 and in 2020, have alternated with periods of frozen conflict over three decades, amidst the inability of the international community to find a political settlement. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has further altered the power balance in the region, creating a dangerous security vacuum and intensifying the need for renewed international mediation towards a comprehensive political settlement. Violent clashes in September 2022, including an incursion by Azerbaijan into Armenian territory, prompted the EU to step up its presence in the region significantly. A new fully fledged civilian mission in Armenia (EUMA Armenia) was deployed in February 2023. The EU has meanwhile taken on a prominent mediation role in the negotiations. Mediation talks, in various formats, have continued during 2022 and 2023, against a background of regular and increasingly violent clashes, with both sides attempting to improve their negotiating positions at the table. The blockade since December 2022 of the Lachin corridor by pro-Azerbaijani activists, followed by the establishment of a checkpoint by Azerbaijan in April 2023, have put additional pressure on Yerevan (and Stepanakert) to agree on a peace deal on Baku's terms. Under EU mediation, complemented by US talks, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed on 14 May 2023 to a longer-term negotiation plan for a comprehensive peace agreement. The final statement included their unequivocal commitment to the 1991 Almaty Declaration and their 'respective territorial integrity'. Some experts see the details of the statement as a potential breakthrough in the peace talks, while others warn of the heavy price-tag for the population of Nagorno-Karabakh and the potential political costs for Armenia itself.",

    "title": "Decarbonising the fishing sector: Energy efficiency measures and alternative energy solutions for fishing vessels",
    "summary": "The fishing sector is facing major challenges in the accelerating energy crisis, owing to its high dependency on the stable supply of fossil fuels at low prices. This report reviews the literature on drivers of energy use, identifies potential reduction measures and provides an overview of opportunities for using alternative fuels in the fishing sector. Each measure is evaluated in terms of greenhouse gas emission reduction potential and costs, and challenges and policy options that could facilitate implementation. A timeline lists measures that could be implemented in the shorter and longer term, on the basis of scientific and grey literature, projects and expert interviews. A considerable reduction in fuel use could be achieved by utilising existing EU regulations to the full (for instance, by rebuilding stocks and allocating fishing rights in accordance with Article 17 of the Basic Regulation on the common fisheries policy). It is crucial to use economic policy instruments, such as taxes, fees and emission quotas widely, to incentivise the transition. A ban on fossil fuel use in fisheries by 2050 would give clear long-term incentives and create the conditions needed for the transition. Such a policy must be accompanied by well-designed funding opportunities for green investments and compensatory measures to avoid increasing short-term costs. Overall, a systems perspective is needed to achieve an energy-efficient, decarbonised fishing sector, without causing other environmental impacts.",

    "title": "Action plan to protect marine ecosystems for sustainable fisheries",
    "summary": "On 21 February 2023, the European Commission published a 'fisheries and oceans' package, including an action plan for reconciling marine protection and fisheries. With this plan, the Commission is hoping to achieve more consistent implementation of EU environmental and fisheries policies. The main aim is to make fishing practices more sustainable by improving gear selectivity and reducing impacts on sensitive species (such as dolphins) and the seabed. On seabeds, the Commission is calling for a ban on mobile bottom fishing in marine protected areas (MPAs) by 2030. To address the negative socio-economic impacts of this, it is proposing measures to ensure a 'just transition' (by making better use of EU funding instruments, in particular for innovation \u2013 for instance, to develop new techniques \u2013 and for diversification of economic activities). The Commission presented the action plan to the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries (PECH) on 1 March 2023 and the EU Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries provided additional clarifications at the PECH meeting on 26 April 2023. Key to the debate is the legal framework for the proposed actions. Environmental policy is a shared competence of the Member States and the Union, and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) introduced an integrated approach to the marine ecosystem. To achieve the MSFD objectives, Member States need to adopt national measures, such as better protection and conservation of seabed habitats and reduction of bycatch from fisheries. According to the Commission, the proposed measures are intended to implement existing environmental legislation. They are non-binding recommendations for national plans \u2013 roadmaps to be drawn up by Member States \u2013 to explore ways to reduce the environmental impact of fishing. When it comes to the common fisheries policy, regionalisation would be the appropriate instrument. This means taking regional differences and different levels of government into account when making decisions. The PECH committee is currently preparing an own-initiative report on the action plan.",

    "title": "Energy transition in the EU fisheries and aquaculture sector",
    "summary": "Energy is a major cost item in EU fisheries and aquaculture. The recent energy crisis has hit the seafood sector hard, notably because of increased marine diesel prices, exposing one of the sector's major vulnerabilities: its high dependency on fossil fuels. A move towards alternative energy sources would not only address this vulnerability but also contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal and the EU's ambition to become climate neutral. On 21 February 2023, the European Commission published a 'fisheries and oceans' package, which includes an action plan on decarbonising EU fisheries and aquaculture. The plan outlines two directions of change: it aims to increase energy efficiency in the short to medium term, while making a gradual switch from fossil fuels to renewable and low-carbon energy sources. An indicative target has been set for fisheries, namely to reduce fossil fuel intensity (in litres per kilogram of landed product) by at least 15 % in the years from 2019 to 2030. The final goal is to achieve a CO2-neutral footprint by 2050. To accelerate this energy transition, the action plan includes initiatives to stimulate research and innovation, develop the required labour skills, and improve the business environment, including funding opportunities. The Commission will launch an 'energy transition partnership for EU fisheries and aquaculture' on 16 June 2023 to steer the process, involving all stakeholders. The Commission presented the action plan to the European Parliament's Committee on Fisheries (PECH) on 1 March 2023, and the EU Commissioner responsible provided additional clarifications at the PECH meeting of 26 April 2023. A recurring point of discussion is the capacity definition in the common fisheries policy, in particular fleet capacity ceilings. New technologies typically require more weight than conventional diesel engines, which would increase a vessel's capacity and could lead to a ceiling being exceeded. As a solution, the Commission refers to the possibility of redistributing available (inactive) capacity in the Member States' fleets. This issue would be discussed with Member States and stakeholders in the context of the energy transition partnership.",

However, improvements in road safety have fallen short of the EU goals of decreasing the number of road deaths by 50 % between 2001 and 2010, and by an additional 50 % between 2011 and 2020. Directive (EU) 2015/413 facilitating cross-border exchange of information on road safety-related traffic offences \u2013 the Cross-border Enforcement (CBE) Directive \u2013 is one of the pillars of the policy framework to improve road safety in the EU. It aims to help improve road safety by tackling the relative impunity of non-resident drivers. The revision, announced in the European Commission's sustainable and smart mobility strategy in 2020, seeks to address key shortcomings in existing rules. According to Commission estimates, 40 % of cross-border offences were committed with impunity, either because the offender was not identified or because the payment was not enforced. The Commission tabled its proposal to revise the CBE Directive as part of the road safety package on 1 March 2023.

    "summary": "This briefing focuses on policy measures benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that have been enshrined in the national recovery and resilience plans (NRRPs). Member States drew up their recovery plans in order to take advantage of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) recovery instrument and its Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), designed to support recovery from the pandemic while fostering the green and digital transitions. The RRF is structured around six pillars representing key EU policy areas that will help Member States emerge from the crisis stronger and future-proof. The pillars also define investment priorities and the scope of financing under the RRF. On account of its particular relevance for SMEs, this briefing addresses the RRF's 'Smart, sustainable and inclusive growth' pillar, but other pillars can also include SME-related measures. The SME sector, including micro-enterprises, constitutes over 99 % of all businesses in the EU and was severely affected by the pandemic. Since SMEs represent the bedrock of the economy, it was essential to support them, and Member States have put forward extensive measures in their NRRPs targeting the SME sector both directly and indirectly. SME-related measures range from learning opportunities for SME employees to advance their digital skills to business decarbonisation, the setting up of new financing instruments aimed at developing new technologies in SMEs, and the removal of administrative and regulatory obstacles to boost the productivity of smaller businesses. SME-related measures under the 'Smart, sustainable and inclusive growth' pillar may also address other RRF objectives, including the specific digital and climate targets. While the type and scope of the investments and reforms vary between Member States, all the measures feed into at least one of the three axes of the SME strategy developed and presented by the European Commission in 2020. These axes refer to capacity building and support for transition to sustainability and digitalisation, reducing the regulatory burden and improving market access, and boosting access to financing. These dimensions are also reflected in the country-specific recommendations (CSRs), presented in the context of the European Semester. To obtain RRF funding, the NRRP measures must address at least a significant subset of the 2019 and 2020 CSRs.",

A wide range of sources \u2013 such as fuels used for road transport, energy used for heating and cooling in buildings, animal digestion and fertilisers used in agriculture, waste treatment, and small industries \u2013 account for these emissions. To cut the emissions in these sectors, the EU Effort-sharing Regulation (ESR) establishes collective and national binding targets and sets up annual emissions allocations for each Member State for the 2021-2030 period. On 14 July 2021, the European Commission submitted a proposal to amend the binding annual emissions reductions by Member States from 2021 to 2030. The proposal is part of the 'fit for 55' package, which aims to adapt EU climate and energy legislation to the new EU objective of a minimum 55 % reduction in net GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, in accordance with the recent European Climate Law. To contribute to the new climate ambition, sectors covered by the ESR have to achieve a collective reduction of 40 % in their emissions by 2030 compared to 2005.

The fast-changing, mobile nature of the sector and its growing market prominence poses challenges, however, for tax authorities, which are not always able to track the capital gains made from trading crypto-assets. On 8 December 2022, the European Commission proposed to set up a reporting framework which would require crypto-asset service providers to report transactions made by EU clients. This would help tax authorities to track the trade of crypto-assets and the proceeds gained, thereby reducing the risk of tax fraud and evasion. The reporting framework would be set-up by amending the Directive on Administrative Cooperation (DAC), which is the main framework for other data exchanges between tax authorities. The proposal also puts forward a series of (smaller) changes to improve the existing exchange of tax-related information. The proposed directive is subject to a special legislative procedure, requiring unanimous support in the Council, following consultation of the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee.

The proposal is part of the second batch of proposals in the 'fit for 55' package, aiming to align EU climate and energy laws with the EU Climate Law's 2030 target. The proposal aims to address gaps in current legislation: those relating to methane emissions from upstream exploration and the production of oil and fossil gas, but also those from the gathering and processing of fossil gas, the transmission, distribution and underground storage of gas, and liquid gas terminals operating with fossil and/or renewable methane. In Parliament, the proposal was referred to the Committees on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) and on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE). On 26 April 2023, the committees adopted a joint report, introducing several amendments to the proposal. For instance, by 31 December 2025 the Commission would have to set a binding 2030 EU methane emissions reduction target covering all relevant emitting sectors. The report would make changes to the monitoring and reporting requirements and the mitigation measures. Parliament adopted its position for the trilogue negotiations on 9 May 2023, without changes to the joint committee report. Third edition.

In the joint statement issued after the meeting \u2013 which referred to the bilateral relationship as a 'no-limits friendship' \u2013 the Chinese leader for the first time voiced his country's outright opposition to NATO enlargement and support for Russia's 'proposals to create long-term legally binding security guarantees' in Europe. It remains, however, unclear whether Putin informed Xi of his intention to invade Ukraine. On 24 February, 4 days after the end of the Winter Olympics, Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The China-Russia relationship has seen major shifts since 1992. At the outset, China's population was greater than Russia's and the two countries had very similar level of total gross domestic product. Nowadays, thanks to China's exceptional growth performance and the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine, China's economy is estimated to be up to 10 times bigger than Russia's. Similarly, trade with Russia is not of major importance to China in terms of value. However, the high share of raw materials (including food) in Russian exports and the transfer of Russian military technology are of strategic importance to China. Since 2012 \u2013 when Xi was first made General-Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) \u2013 the relationship has evolved into an informal alliance in the face of what both countries consider a rising threat from the West to their regimes. China's response to Russia's war on Ukraine \u2013 a balancing act sometimes referred to as 'pro-Russia neutrality' \u2013 has so far been much closer to Russia than it was in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea. At the same time, developments since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 have increased Russia's dependency on China, which some now qualify as a rising 'vassalisation' of Russia. This is an update of a briefing originally published in March 2022.",

    "summary": "EU support for the implementation of Slovenia's National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) amounts to \u20ac2 482.3 million, and includes \u20ac1 776.9 million in grants and \u20ac705.4 million in loans. This amount should be committed by the end of 2023, and paid out to Slovenia by the end of 2026. While the overall allocation represents only 0.3 % of the total Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), it stood at 5.1 % of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 (the RRF being 5.2 % of EU-27 GDP in 2019). In June 2022, Slovenia's grant allocation was revised downwards to 1.49 billion (-16 %). However, thanks to the February 2023 agreement enabling Member States to add REPowerEU chapters to their plans, Slovenia's envelope will be replenished with \u20ac116.9 million in grants to be spent on energy measures. Slovenia has already decided to use 22 % of the maximum amount of loans available, and has declared its intention to request a further amount. With \u20ac1 038 per citizen (grants and loans), Slovenia is among the 10 biggest RRF beneficiaries per capita. So far, Slovenia has received \u20ac280.6 million in grants (\u20ac231 million in pre-financing and \u20ac49.6 million for the first instalment), but no payments for loans. Remaining payments \u2013 nine instalments for grants and six for loans \u2013 will depend on progress in implementing the plan. Slovenia's NRRP tackles both the COVID-19 pandemic's socio-economic consequences and more long-standing challenges identified in the Slovenian development strategy 2030. The plan is strongly focused on the green and digital transitions. Planned spending on these areas exceeds the compulsory targets, totalling 42.4 % for climate and 21.4 % for digital. Other priority areas include smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and health and welfare. The European Parliament participates in interinstitutional forums for cooperation and discussion on RRF implementation, and scrutinises the European Commission's work.

However, it is the large changes in relative prices and not the average inflation rate (of now 7%) that is the real problem. We also show that rents \u2013 which are more important for low-income households \u2013 provide a significant offset for higher energy prices on average for the euro area, as they have lagged inflation, albeit with large differences across countries.",

Ukraine has denied any role in the raid, while Russia has blamed \u2018Ukrainian nationalists\u2019 for the attack, and its Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, has vowed that Moscow will respond to any more cross-border raids swiftly and \u2018extremely harshly.\u2019 At the G7 summit of industrialised and democratic nations on 19-21 May, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked for more arms supplies for his country, including F-16 fighter jets. Russia said that the transfer of such planes would raise the question of NATO's role in the 15-month-old military conflict.

    "summary": "In absolute figures, Cyprus's National Recovery and Resilience Plan amounts to \u20ac1.2 billion. Cyprus decided to use its allocation under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) predominantly in grants (\u20ac1.005 billion), with \u20ac200.3 million in loans. These resources represent around 0.2 % of the entire RRF, but are equal to 5.2 % of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 (the RRF being 5.2 % of EU-27 GDP in 2019). They will underpin a vast programme of reforms and investments that aims to promote the recovery of the Cypriot economy (Cyprus's GDP dropped by 5.2 % in 2020), while addressing a number of structural weaknesses as well as pursuing major objectives such as the green transition and the digital transformation. In June 2022, Cyprus' grant allocation was revised downwards to 915.9 million (9.8%), based on the relevant provision in the RRF Regulation. Measures under Cyprus's plan are to be completed in 2026. Cyprus has so far received 20 % of the resources in the form of pre-financing and one payment for grants and loans. This is below the EU average. The remaining amounts in grants and loans will be paid depending on the implementation of the remaining 135 milestones and 122 targets.

    "title": "New economic governance rules",
    "summary": "On 26 April 2023, the European Commission published a package of three proposals to revise the EU's economic governance framework: a regulation to replace the current preventive arm of the stability and growth pact (SGP), an amending Council regulation on the corrective arm of the SGP, and an amending Council directive to strengthen the role of independent fiscal institutions. The main proposal on the preventive arm is to be adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure with the Parliament and the Council as co-legislators. The reform proposals are shaped by the trade-off between reducing higher and more dispersed public debt levels after several years of unprecedented fiscal challenges and the need for sustained public investment in the Union's shared priorities. Stricter fiscal monitoring would ensure debt sustainability, based on a country-specific fiscal adjustment path anchored to a debt sustainability analysis framework. The Commission would negotiate a fiscal-structural plan bilaterally with Member States, with a minimum 4-year horizon; possible extension of the fiscal adjustment path to 7 years would provide an incentive to include investment and reform commitments. Greater political buy-in and better Member State ownership of the medium-term plan is also envisaged. Both reference values \u2013 the 3 % deficit-to-GDP and 60 % debt-to-GDP ratios \u2013 would remain unchanged, the proposal introduces three additional safeguards: two numerical requirements over the agreed plan's horizon and a minimum fiscal adjustment of 0.5 % of GDP per annum if a country is expected to be above the 3 % deficit ratio threshold in an excessive deficit procedure.

    "title": "Migrant women and the EU labour market: Overcoming double discrimination",
    "summary": "Migrant women play an increasingly important socio-economic role in the European Union (EU). Once mostly seen as partners joining migrant men, foreign-born women increasingly migrate alone in search of work. Globally, although around half of migrants are nowadays women, their integration in host societies is often problematic. This is partly due to obstacles resulting from the institutional framework of host countries. A migrant woman's status \u2013 i.e. whether she is legally or irregularly resident \u2013 is likely to shape her migration experience. Those who migrate for work are expected to 'fill the gaps' in the labour market. Often this means working in low-paid and unregulated sectors of the economy, where they are likely to be over-qualified. Employment and legal status are inter-related: both have an impact on the migrant woman's access to public services. Yet many migrant women, especially those with young children, face barriers to accessing the labour market. The European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) confirms that migrant women are more likely to be unemployed or economically inactive than any other group in the EU labour market. While EU legal instruments prohibit discrimination based on sex or race, both the European Parliament and civil society organisations point to the lack of a gender dimension in EU policies. Most EU Member States' national integration policies do not prioritise migrant women, although some address them as a way to promote gender equality. Many countries have acknowledged the need for more gender-sensitive policies and initiated good practices focused on helping migrant women access the labour market and integrate in society.",

    "summary": "For over 30 years, the EU has been pursuing the objective of developing an efficient and competitive EU-wide railway network, the single European railway area. By integrating national rail systems, rail should become more competitive, ultimately allowing transport to become more sustainable. Efficient, safe and interoperable rail services need train drivers who can work seamlessly across borders and across operational and language barriers. In the absence of an EU-wide certification scheme, however, EU train drivers seeking to work in another Member State or assigned to operations in several Member States were, for a long time, confronted with a patchwork of different national certification schemes. To smooth the way for train drivers' mobility and cross-border operations within the EU, in 2007, the EU adopted Directive 2007/59/EC on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Community (the 'Train Drivers' Directive' \u2013 TDD). By setting up a scheme including a licence with EU-wide validity and complementary certificates for trains and infrastructure, the TDD increased train drivers' mobility and interoperability. However, as shown in a European Commission ex-post evaluation carried out in 2020, the directive did not solve the fragmentation issue completely. Rail is set to play a key role in further decarbonising transport in line with the 2019 European Green Deal. A growing number of mobile train drivers will be needed if EU high-speed rail and rail freight traffic is to expand significantly in the future, in line with the 2020 sustainable and smart mobility strategy. Moreover, further digitalisation and innovation will require adjustments to training and certification. For these reasons, in its 2022 work programme, the Commission announced a proposal to revise the TDD (expected in July 2023, at the time of drafting).",

To support the uptake of sustainable maritime fuels, the Commission proposes to limit the carbon intensity of the energy used on board ships. Accordingly, the proposal sets a fuel standard for ships and introduces a requirement for the most polluting ship types to use onshore electricity when at berth. It puts the responsibility for compliance on the shipping company. In the European Parliament, the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) has been leading the work on this file.

    "summary": "The European Union has been regulating pharmaceuticals for over 50 years. The legal regulation aims to protect public health and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market in medicinal products. In 2020, the European Commission published a pharmaceutical strategy for Europe aimed at reinforcing the EU pharmaceutical system by making it more patient-centred and resistant to crises (such as pandemics). The achievement of these objectives requires the revision of several pieces of EU legislation regulating pharmaceuticals, including the EU general pharmaceutical legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004). This briefing informs parliamentary decision-making by presenting findings on the implementation of the EU legislation falling within the scope of the revision.",

The hearing was scheduled out of concern for declining levels of press freedom in Central Europe, in this context it is important to discuss the vital role that a free media fulfils in society. This briefing will provide a background on the role of investigative journalists before moving on to discuss the role that they play in uncovering fraud and corruption in Europe. It will then discuss the decline of press freedom in Central Europe before analysing different policies that could be used to protect investigative journalists.",

    "summary": "The required deployment of clean energy technologies to support the achievement of Europe's 2030 and 2050 climate targets is considerable. Europe already largely imports these technologies, and many third countries have stepped up their efforts to expand their clean energy manufacturing capacity. On 16 March 2023, the Commission put forward a proposal for a 'net-zero industry act' that aims to expand the manufacturing capacity of net-zero technologies in the EU and enhance the resilience of its energy system. The proposed regulation would set up enabling conditions for the manufacturing of 10 net-zero technologies (through streamlined administrative processes and access to regulatory sandboxes and European net-zero industry academies). Eight 'strategic' net-zero technologies would gain additional benefits (even shorter administrative processes, facilitated access to markets, and administrative support to access finance). The proposed regulation would aim to ensure that, by 2030, the manufacturing capacity in the EU for these strategic net-zero technologies reaches an overall benchmark of at least 40 % of the EU's annual deployment needs. It would also set an EU level target for annual CO2 injection capacity by 2030 (50 million tonnes). The proposal is now in the hands of the co-legislators. In the European Parliament, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) is responsible for the file. First edition.

Moreover, to end Europe's dependence on semiconductor suppliers from Asian countries, it is necessary to take immediate action of a structural nature, involving all EU Member States and all participants in regional supply markets. The overall aim of this study was to identify drivers of and barriers to building up open strategic autonomy at EU level, before recommending coordinated solutions and addressing supply chain resilience in four critical areas: food security, energy security, semiconductors and satellite communications. This research seeks to contribute to the European Parliament's future work by providing insights into how to protect the European agricultural sector, ensure energy security and the technological sovereignty of semiconductor production, and improve satellite communications.",

    "summary": "On 27 February 2023, the European Commission published a proposal for a regulation to allow voluntary digital labelling of EU fertilising products. This initiative follows similar EU legislative initiatives establishing the digital labelling of goods in other economic sectors, such as batteries. The rationale for digital labelling is provided by: on the one hand, the deployment of digital solutions such as QR codes, which can lower the cost of labelling while facilitating the updating of content; and on the other, the complexification of physical labelling, whose readability can prove difficult. Against this backdrop, the proposal introduces a set of voluntary digital labelling schemes for EU fertilising products, whose requirements depend on the packaging arrangements and the users of the products (economic operators or end-users). The proposal also introduces a single set of technological requirements for all established labels, to ensure that labels are accessible free of charge, including for vulnerable groups.

The 'fit for 55' package is part of the European Green Deal, which aims to put the EU firmly on the path towards climate neutrality by 2050. A key element in the 'fit for 55' package is the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II), to help the EU deliver the new 55 % GHG target. Under RED II, the EU is obliged to ensure at least 32 % of its energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources (RES) by 2030. The revised RED II strengthens these provisions and sets a new EU target of a minimum 40 % share of renewable energy sources (RES) in final energy consumption by 2030, accompanied by new sectoral targets. As part of the REPowerEU plan (May 2022), the Commission proposed to further raise this RES target to a 45 % share by 2030. In the European Parliament, the file was referred to the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety as associated committee under Rule 57. The trilogue negotiations were concluded on 30 March 2023 with a provisional agreement raising the share of renewables to 42.5 % by 2030.

On 16 March 2023, the Commission put forward a proposal for a regulation on CRMs. It introduces the concept of strategic raw materials (SRMs), which are key for some strategic technologies and vulnerable to shortages. The general objective of the proposed regulation is to improve the functioning of the single market by establishing a framework to ensure the EU's access to a secure and sustainable supply of CRMs. To achieve this, the regulation would pursue four specific objectives: strengthening the whole SRM value chain; diversifying the EU's imports of SRMs (so that by 2030, no third country would provide more than 65 % of the EU's annual consumption of each SRM); improving the EU's ability to monitor and mitigate the CRM supply risk; ensuring the free movement of CRMs and products containing CRMs placed on the EU market and ensuring a high level of environmental protection, by improving their circularity and sustainability.

It points to the transboundary nature of climate change as justifying EU action, but the proportionality of the initiative is not discussed and there is no subsidiarity grid to further clarify the proposal's subsidiarity and proportionality aspects. The IA identifies three problems hindering effective and sustainable carbon removal activities; it describes them sufficiently well, but could have given more detail as to their scale in more detail. The IA suggests two sets of policy options (POs) (quality options and governance options) with two alternatives to the baseline per set of options; this raises the question whether the four possible combinations of POs provide a sufficient range of options. The IA assesses the initiative's environmental, economic and social impacts and links them to seven SDGs. It compares the four POs packages for their effectiveness and efficiency. It describes their coherence with other policy initiatives and instruments, and concludes that the preferred option is where the Commission develops certification methodologies and ensures the correct implementation of the framework. An SME test was done and concluded that SMEs were expected to provide a 'very significant contribution to the implementation of the initiative', which 'potentially offers significant financial opportunities for economic operators in these sectors'. The IA discusses the discarded options, such as a mandatory requirement for all EU operators to certify carbon removals in line with the EU framework. The voluntary nature of the initiative could have been explained more clearly. Although the initiative is apparently supported by the majority of stakeholders and the IA consistently refers to stakeholders' opinions and is well founded on available evidence, stakeholders' views on the preferred option could have been presented more transparently. The IA refers to an extensive literature and relevant recent studies; links are provided to most of footnotes and reference documents are mentioned, increasing the transparency and accessibility of the information used.",

    "summary": "The prohibition of discrimination and the protection of human rights are important elements of the EU legal order. Nevertheless, discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people persists throughout the EU and takes various forms, including verbal abuse and physical violence. Sexual orientation is now recognised in EU law as grounds of discrimination. However, the scope of the provisions dealing with this issue is limited and does not cover social protection, health care, education or access to goods and services, leaving LGBTI people particularly vulnerable in these areas. Moreover, EU competence does not extend to recognition of marital or family status. In this area, national regulations vary, with some Member States offering same-sex couples the right to marry, others allowing alternative forms of registration, and yet others not providing any legal status for same-sex couples. Same-sex couples may or may not have the right to adopt children and to access assisted reproduction. These divergent legal statuses have implications, for instance, for partners from two Member States with different standards who want to formalise/legalise their relationship, or for same-sex couples and their families wishing to move to another Member State. Combating discrimination has become part of EU internal and external policies, and is the subject of numerous resolutions of the European Parliament. However, action in this area remains problematic when it touches on issues pertaining to areas traditionally the preserve of Member States, such as marital status and family law.

    "summary": "On 23 February 2022, the European Commission unveiled a proposal for an EU regulation \u2013 the data act \u2013 laying down harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data. The aim is to remove barriers to consumers and businesses' access to data, in a context in which the volume of data generated by humans and machines is increasing exponentially and becoming a critical factor for innovation by businesses (e.g. algorithm training) and by public authorities (e.g. shaping of smart cities). The proposed act establishes common rules governing the sharing of data generated by the use of connected products or related services (e.g. the internet of things, industrial machines) to ensure fairness in data-sharing contracts and to allow public sector bodies to use data held by enterprises where there is an exceptional need (e.g. public emergency). Furthermore, the proposed act introduces new rules to facilitate switching between providers of cloud services and other data-processing services, and puts in place safeguards against unlawful international data transfer by cloud service providers. The Council and Parliament have both proposed substantial amendments to the Commission's text and are now working towards a compromise text. Discussions focus, among other things, on defining the types of data falling in the scope of the act, ensuring that data sharing obligations will not endanger trade secrets, aligning the text with rules already enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation and the Digital Markets Act, and setting the practical and financial details of cloud switching.

    "summary": "The Van Gend & Loos and Costa v ENEL cases, decided on 5 February 1963 and 15 July 1964, respectively, are commonly considered the two building blocks of EU law as an autonomous legal order with direct effect before national courts and primacy over national law. However, there is a third important case, decided between the other two, without which neither direct effect nor primacy of EU law would be considered binding doctrines. On 27 March 1963, on a preliminary reference from the Dutch customs tribunal, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) handed down its judgment in the case of Da Costa en Schaake. The Dutch tribunal asked, as it had previously in Van Gend & Loos, whether the standstill clause in Article 12 of the Treaty of Rome had direct effect. This circumstance raised the question of the binding authority of ECJ judgments outside the framework of the case in which they were pronounced. The view of the civil law tradition was that a judgment is binding only between the parties of the original case, meaning that the Court would have to answer the same question again. By contrast, the Commission asked the Court to dismiss the questions, given that they had already been answered. In its ruling in Da Costa en Schaake, the Court considered that its ruling in Van Gend & Loos was sufficient to answer the question posed by the Dutch tribunal, but did not dismiss the reference. In its answer to the tribunal, the Court did not repeat its previous answer, but indicated that the question had already been answered and that there was therefore no need to answer it again. In this way, the ECJ laid down the foundations for the general authority of its case law: not only is the legal interpretation provided in a judgment binding in the case at hand, it also provides an authoritative interpretation of EU law generally. This doctrine, which is not exactly the same as common law precedent, has been further developed in later ECJ case law.",

They employ almost two thirds of the workforce, create 85 % of all new jobs and generate about three fifths of EU value added. In the period from 2010 to 2020, only a small proportion of EU SMEs said that they raised external financing through capital markets (4 %), while a quarter used bank loans, and a fifth used business-to-business trade credits or internal funds. To make capital markets more attractive to EU SMEs and diversify their sources of external financing, the European Commission tabled three interconnected proposals in December 2022. They seek to streamline the listing process, balancing the regulatory and compliance costs to companies seeking to list, or already listed, and ensuring proper investor protection and market integrity. The key amendments seek to cut red tape in the listing process: at the pre-IPO stage by facilitating the development and provision of investment research while avoiding conflicts of interest inherent in such research; at the IPO stage by making it easier and cheaper for issuers to draw up a prospectus; and at the post-IPO stage by providing more clarity on what constitutes inside information. A new directive on multiple-vote share structures would harmonise national laws and allow listed companies' owners to raise more funds at a given voting share. First edition.

This implementation appraisal starts with a recap of the existing EU policy and legislation on flag States and accident investigations, then reviews and summarises existing evaluations and discussions on their implementation produced by EU institutions and their advisory bodies. The findings of the ex-post evaluations of the directives and statements by relevant stakeholders all indicate that the Flag State Directive and the Accident Investigation Directive have been well transposed and implemented by the Member States concerned and that the system generally performs well, thus contributing to the creation of a level playing field for the sector and increased capacities within national administrations. The directives, adopted in 2009 and in force since 2011, did not introduce major changes to the existing international rules or Member States' practices, but integration into the EU acquis allowed harmonised enforcement. Today, based on the experience gained over more than a decade of relatively unproblematic implementation, the co-legislators should be able to review both directives to introduce further simplification and mostly technical updates, reflecting past and upcoming transformation of the industry (digitalisation, new fuels, autonomous vessels...), and to stay aligned with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) framework. A possible broadening of the scope, of when accidents should be investigated depending on their severity and type of vessel, should also be considered.",

    "summary": "On 14 March 2023, European Commission launched two legislative initiatives: one to improve European electricity market design, the other to offer better protection against market manipulation on the wholesale energy market. These targeted reforms address shortcomings revealed by the current energy crisis, in particular price volatility and security of supply. They also introduce long-term changes necessary to achieve the Green Deal targets. EU electricity market design development started in 1996 as part of the integration of the energy market, itself driven by successive legislative packages, such as the clean energy for all Europeans package of 2019. Over the past decade, integrated electricity markets have generated a welfare benefit of around \u20ac34 billion per year. Despite this positive development, the implementation of these measures has been slower than anticipated on several fronts. Findings relating to their practical implementation and application shed light on the performance of electricity market design and underpin the revision examined in the present document. In addition to identifying room for improvement, these findings emphasise that continuous implementation of the existing measures remains crucial for reaping the benefits of an integrated electricity market. The Commission would like to see the reforms adopted before end of the year. Given the urgency, the proposals deviate from the interinstitutional better law-making principles. They lack an evaluation that would have analysed the performance of the existing market design and an impact assessment that would have examined the economic, social and environmental impacts of possible policy options. Instead, the rationale behind the proposed interventions and related evidence is explained in a Commission staff working document.",

This would revise the existing Product Liability Directive, adopted nearly 40 years ago in 1985. The proposal aims to bring the European Union's product liability regime up to speed with the digital age, circular economy business models and global value chains. The proposal introduces new provisions to address liability for products such as software (including artificial intelligence systems) and digital services that affect how the product works (e.g. navigation services in autonomous vehicles). It also alleviates the burden of proof for victims under certain circumstances. The proposal clarifies the liability rules for companies that substantially modify products before resale to extend the product lifecycle (circular economy). The proposed rules would also ensure that consumers are compensated for defective products manufactured outside the EU.

    "summary": "This study, commissioned by the European Parliament\u2019s Policy Department for Citizens\u2019 Rights and Constitutional Affairs at the request of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), examines and makes recommendations on the two Directives on standards for equality bodies proposed by the Commission in 2022. It explores the current situation for equality bodies, establishing issues that trammel their potential due to inadequacies in the design of their institutional architecture, and the conditions created for their independence, effectiveness, and accessibility. The study finds that the Directives, while requiring strengthening, hold significant promise.",

    "title": "From growth to 'beyond growth': Concepts and challenges",
    "summary": "Economic growth brought widespread prosperity in the post-war era. It contributed to rising living standards, reducing poverty and increasing tax revenues to fund public policies. However, the focus on growth has increasingly been criticised for overlooking negative social and environmental impacts. The debate on going beyond growth aims to steer policy-making towards multiple economic, social and environmental goals rather than treating growth as an end in itself. While a part of this debate focuses on indicators (beyond GDP), other ideas explore the options for new economic narratives around growth and eventually bringing about a systemic shift and fundamental transformation. A number of approaches have been proposed in the debate on growth \u2013 for instance, green and inclusive growth, post-growth and degrowth. Alternative policy frameworks have also been created, such as Doughnut Economics and Sustainable Development Goals, to bring multidimensional goals into policy-making. The EU has come up with a number of policy initiatives supporting green and inclusive growth, most recently the European Green Deal and the European Pillar of Social Rights. These are accompanied by social and environmental indicators that are increasingly used in assessments of legislation, forecasting and even the cycle of economic governance. National and regional initiatives have also been implemented. As Europe, along with a number of other advanced economies, has been experiencing a period of low growth and sees itself confronted with the climate challenge, the debate on rethinking economic narratives to move towards a more multidimensional conception of socio-economic progress has seen renewed interest. This briefing has been prepared ahead of the Beyond Growth 2023 conference, taking place in the European Parliament from 15 to 17 May 2023. It is complemented by a more extensive study, Beyond growth.",

    "title": "Beyond growth: Pathways towards sustainable prosperity in the EU",
    "summary": "From 15 to 17 May 2023 the European Parliament is hosting a conference on the topic 'Beyond Growth'. This study introduces participants and other stakeholders and interested parties to the debate on going beyond growth. Organised in two parts, the study first presents the status quo, with our reliance on economic growth as the main policy driver and gross domestic product (GDP) as a key economic measure, blind spots related to this reliance, and the need to address multiple system failures. It notes today's focus on research and innovation and describes measures already brought forward in the European Green Deal to this effect. The second part of the study explores the case for changing the underlying system drivers, and how system transformation may come about. It presents a range of existing or suggested policy frameworks to effect changes, before moving on to specific tools that are relevant for realising economic transitions. A recap of the debate and challenges rounds off the study.",

    "title": "CO2 emission standards for new cars and vans: 'Fit for 55' package",
    "summary": "On 14 July 2021, as part of the 'fit for 55' package, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal for a revision of the Regulation setting CO2 emission performance standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (vans). To increase the contribution of the road transport sector to the EU's climate targets, the proposal sets more ambitious 2030 targets for reducing the CO2 emissions of new cars and vans, and allows only zero-emission vehicles from 2035. Stakeholders have expressed mixed views about the proposal as regards its ambition, the impact on the automotive industry, alternative fuels infrastructure and the potential role of sustainable fuels. The Parliament and the Council adopted their positions in June 2022, and reached a trilogue agreement in October 2022. The regulation was adopted in March 2023 and published in the Official Journal on 25 April 2023. It enters into force on 15 May 2023. Fifth edition. The 'EU Legislation in Progress' briefings are updated at key stages throughout the legislative procedure.",

    "title": "Revision of the Ozone Regulation",
    "summary": "Stratospheric ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun and reduces the overall amount of radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are human-made chemicals that, once emitted, reach the upper atmosphere and destroy the protective ozone layer, causing what is known as the ozone hole. They have significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment and are also greenhouse gases with high global warming potential. Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer lays down rules on the production, use, trade, recovery, recycling, reclamation and destruction of ODS and sets out requirements and measures for products and equipment containing these substances. On 5 April 2022, the European Commission submitted a proposal for a regulation on ODS repealing the current one. The aim is to increase the efficiency of the existing measures in order to achieve additional emission reductions in line with the European Green Deal, to ensure more comprehensive monitoring of ODS, to reduce the administrative costs by simplifying the rules, to modernise the licensing system and reduce costs for industry, and to improve the coherence with other pieces of legislation such as Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases, which is being revised in parallel. One of the main objectives of the proposal is to prevent emissions from old products and equipment still containing ODS that have to be recovered and destroyed. The file has been referred to the European Parliament's Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). Parliament adopted amendments to the proposal on 30 March 2023, setting its position for interinstitutional negotiations (trilogues). Second edition. The 'EU Legislation in Progress' briefings are updated at key stages throughout the legislative procedure.",

    "title": "Understanding silent and invisible assets",
    "summary": "At a time when global and cross-border crises are highlighting the interconnections between health, environment, peace, food security and energy sufficiency, notions such as externalities, public goods and biodiversity boundaries are gaining renewed interest, as a strong grasp of the various aspects of challenging situations becomes essential to help frame policy responses. The notion of externalities is about asking whether all elements have been accounted for in price setting. When this is not the case, the mismatch is described as a positive or negative externality. The question then is how to correct the situation through pricing and with a price signal \u2013 something that can be achieved through taxation or regulation. Beyond pricing, public goods \u2013 as opposed to private goods \u2013 are goods and services that can be enjoyed by all. They bring advantages to society as a whole, and their geographical scope can vary from local and regional to global. Moving one step further, it is necessary to consider the effects on public goods of activities that might not be seen or occur at the same time or in the same place as the activities themselves. This relates to notions such as tipping points, footprints, sustainability and the preservation of biodiversity. This briefing aims to shed light on those invisible effects, to complement existing discussions and pave the way for new tools to address environmental challenges.",

    "title": "EU critical raw materials act",
    "summary": "As the first EU act specifically regulating the EU's CRM supply, the proposed initiative aims to address an area previously identified as one of the EU's strategic dependencies. Following a clear problem description, the IA presents three (partially overlapping) policy options and a thorough analysis of their possible impacts, with a clear focus on economic impacts. The identification of the preferred policy option appears justified. The predominantly qualitative assessment draws merely on desk research and stakeholder input. In this respect, the IA admits to having 'significant data gaps' and a 'limited' evidence base, owing in part to 'the lack of a supporting study'. With regard to stakeholder input, the IA does not explain why the public consultation was open for only 8 weeks (instead of the default 12). It is notable that the proposed regulation deviates somewhat in scope from the IA: it adds a further specific objective \u2013 namely to diversify CRM imports in order to reduce strategic dependencies \u2013 and provides for a few measures that were either not assessed at all in the IA, or which were outside the preferred policy option.",
